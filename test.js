29/05/2019, 15:18 - James Kemp: Have you heard of x?
29/05/2019, 15:18 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm honest but energetic and say no

29/05/2019, 15:19 - James Kemp: And presume with that name they‚Äôre a bunch of wankers
29/05/2019, 15:19 - James Kemp: So I go off on how they‚Äôve got this really aspirational brand image
29/05/2019, 15:20 - James Kemp: But I‚Äôm skeptical about whether their teaching has the credibility to back it up
29/05/2019, 15:20 - James Kemp: She responds

30/05/2019, 08:29 - Aaron Ayling: Liz is your Dad rejoicing at Illinois making weed legal today?
30/05/2019, 08:29 - Aaron Ayling: And I don't know what this means but they're the first state to "legalise sale via legislation" which seems to be a bug deal?
30/05/2019, 09:00 - +44 7752 359588: Wild
30/05/2019, 09:00 - +44 7752 359588: I didn't even know about this haha

30/05/2019, 10:17 - Johnny Stowellman: She's from the inner north of Melbourne. It's the equivalent of putting on an eastend accent if you're from Richmond

30/05/2019, 10:21 - Johnny Stowellman: TL;DR I hate her

30/05/2019, 16:04 - Johnny Stowellman: I'd dreamt a massive (really massive) grasshopper was next to my bed and attacking my face

04/06/2019, 10:04 - James Kemp: et voila!

07/06/2019, 14:45 - James Kemp: she told me i wasn't the obvious choice
07/06/2019, 14:45 - James Kemp: apparently they'd been advised against going with people with agency backgrounds
07/06/2019, 14:45 - James Kemp: and this other girl had worked in a startup
07/06/2019, 14:45 - James Kemp: STILL BEAT HER üñïüèª
07/06/2019, 14:46 - Johnny Stowellman: What was the thought process there?
07/06/2019, 14:46 - James Kemp: i think just the fact it's going to be a lot of practical delivery
07/06/2019, 14:46 - James Kemp: building a website, running events, executing social media
07/06/2019, 14:46 - James Kemp: as well as all teh strategy for them
07/06/2019, 14:46 - James Kemp: and obviously agencies (at least the ones i work at) tend to only do the strategy part
07/06/2019, 14:47 - Johnny Stowellman: Aah
07/06/2019, 14:47 - James Kemp: so switching from being the advisor to the owner
07/06/2019, 14:47 - James Kemp: i guess is an insecurity

14/06/2019, 10:21 - Johnny Stowellman: No sausage rolls!?
14/06/2019, 10:21 - James Kemp: Toad in the hole needs to go up a tier
14/06/2019, 10:22 - James Kemp: Pork pies too
14/06/2019, 10:22 - Johnny Stowellman: Surely haggis gets 1+ level up
14/06/2019, 10:22 - Johnny Stowellman: if only for cultural posterity
14/06/2019, 10:22 - Sam Lea: Surely the responses skewed by population there ie ain't no Scots
14/06/2019, 10:22 - Sam Lea: (many)
14/06/2019, 10:22 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm triggered that they‚Äôve put us faggots on the crap tier
14/06/2019, 10:23 - James Kemp: Broadly, not a bad list
14/06/2019, 10:23 - James Kemp: Needs a bit of tweaking before going to the client

14/06/2019, 10:27 - Aaron Ayling: Just a bit boring
14/06/2019, 10:27 - Aaron Ayling: Yorkshires tend to be disappointing I find
14/06/2019, 10:27 - James Kemp: 2/3 of your top tier is also ü§¢
14/06/2019, 10:28 - James Kemp: At least we would never fight over a singular platter of all this food
14/06/2019, 10:28 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm finding the positive amidst this treachery
14/06/2019, 10:28 - Aaron Ayling: Haha give me that congealed blood

14/06/2019, 10:35 - +44 7462 872590: How is Yorkshire Pudding above Steak and Kidney Pie?
14/06/2019, 10:35 - Aaron Ayling: My mid tier rating of the bacon sandwich was based on it just being this btw. Chuck an egg or a sausage in with it and we'll talk again
14/06/2019, 10:36 - Aaron Ayling: Coz it's a list of popularity of "do you like this y/n" and Yorkshire pudding is so bland that no one's gonna say no
14/06/2019, 10:36 - Aaron Ayling: But steak and kidney pie has kidneys in it
14/06/2019, 10:36 - Aaron Ayling: Doesn't explain why cheese on toast is mid tier though
14/06/2019, 10:37 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>

14/06/2019, 10:59 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah I was just wondering why it wasn't higher on the list as presented
14/06/2019, 11:00 - Aaron Ayling: Like all those foods (bar jellied eels and kippers) are great, just some are slightly more great
14/06/2019, 11:02 - Johnny Stowellman: I think I'm broadly behind this reshuffle
14/06/2019, 11:03 - James Kemp: BYE

14/06/2019, 12:56 - Aaron Ayling: But pro austerity in the face of overwhelming evidence that is is terrible for the economy on every level is pretty unforgiveable for me
14/06/2019, 13:05 - Johnny Stowellman: There‚Äôs a damning Guardian in focus podcast about the effects of austerity cuts for the disabled, really sad
14/06/2019, 13:52 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>

28/06/2019, 10:35 - James Kemp: so many of this office falls into the bracket of "entrepreneur, but only because daddy's money allows me to have the backing to be one"
28/06/2019, 10:35 - James Kemp: there's a guy sat in a meeting room opposite me - must be late 30s

28/06/2019, 10:40 - Johnny Stowellman: there is some sick cosmic justice that being blessed with that much privilege often inhibits you from good taste and basic awareness
28/06/2019, 10:40 - James Kemp: can you imagine if you were in a meeting with a grown-ass man who did that?
28/06/2019, 10:40 - James Kemp: girl it ain't 19 and this ain't yo cambridge undergrad economics lecture

28/06/2019, 13:40 - James Kemp: but i'd rather do mine
28/06/2019, 13:40 - Reuben Yarwood: That's one of those urban legend type sex moves I've never been sure about the veracity of
28/06/2019, 13:41 - Johnny Stowellman: Seems improbable
28/06/2019, 13:41 - Johnny Stowellman: And to what end?
28/06/2019, 13:41 - Sam Lea: Gonna have to be some serious girth discrepancy to make that work
28/06/2019, 13:41 - Aaron Ayling: There's a great cartoon called venture brothers, where the main character is a famous ex child star called Rusty Venture. In one episode they spend it just arguing over what the sex move called a Rusty Venture actually is haha
28/06/2019, 13:42 - Aaron Ayling: Urban dictionary says space docking is pooping into a vagina
28/06/2019, 13:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Urban dictionary says a lot of things

28/06/2019, 13:46 - James Kemp: yeah docking is willy in willy
28/06/2019, 13:46 - James Kemp: no 'space' required in that one
28/06/2019, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: We were talking about expressing extremes and she asked me if I would say "not in a New York minute"
28/06/2019, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: I was thinking I'd just say "no fucking way"
28/06/2019, 13:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Alas no swearing in the office
28/06/2019, 13:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Hackneyed American slang for you

09/07/2019, 11:14 - James Kemp: when are results?
09/07/2019, 11:15 - Reuben Yarwood: It was harder than I expected!
09/07/2019, 11:16 - Reuben Yarwood: The whole experience was super intense and I was nervous af even through I knew I'd breezeed through it at home
09/07/2019, 11:18 - Reuben Yarwood: It's exactly as you'd imagine - in a dusty old lecture room, the parts of the test are like just over two hours total but there's loads of sitting there in absolute silence as they painstakingly hand out all the papers and explain the rules at great length in Japanese
09/07/2019, 11:18 - Reuben Yarwood: And they hold up yellow cards and red cards etc.
09/07/2019, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Don't hear back until September. I'd be very surprised if I didn't pass
09/07/2019, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: I imagine doing N2 or N1 is well difficult
09/07/2019, 11:20 - James Kemp: yeah our mate was degree-educated in japanese
09/07/2019, 11:20 - James Kemp: had lived there for years
09/07/2019, 11:20 - James Kemp: failed n1
09/07/2019, 11:20 - James Kemp: apparently his test was super technical meteorological language
09/07/2019, 11:20 - James Kemp: about weather patterns and space and shit
09/07/2019, 11:20 - Reuben Yarwood: Apparently most Japanese natives couldn't pass without a lot of work
09/07/2019, 11:20 - Reuben Yarwood: That's just nuts
09/07/2019, 11:20 - James Kemp: just really field specific shit
09/07/2019, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: The Japanese being extra as per usual
09/07/2019, 11:21 - James Kemp: doing the MOST
09/07/2019, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Might go for N3 in December though, stretch goal
09/07/2019, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: He says, barely able to order a cuppa in Japanese
09/07/2019, 11:22 - James Kemp: skipping n4?
09/07/2019, 11:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah fuck it
09/07/2019, 11:23 - Johnny Stowellman: This takes me back
09/07/2019, 11:24 - Johnny Stowellman: I went for N1 but preparation was utterly derailed by pints
09/07/2019, 11:25 - Johnny Stowellman: Vaguely remember managing about 50-60% of the answers but knew I didn't have enough to get over the line
09/07/2019, 11:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice
09/07/2019, 11:26 - Reuben Yarwood: Was it not intense as hell?
09/07/2019, 11:26 - Johnny Stowellman: But yeah the people I spoke to before the test had been living in the country for years and had tried a couple of times, so I felt less guilty about bombing out
09/07/2019, 11:26 - Johnny Stowellman: Haha yep, very old skool
09/07/2019, 11:27 - Reuben Yarwood: How's the new place man?
09/07/2019, 11:27 - Johnny Stowellman: At the moment it's a total hellscape
09/07/2019, 11:27 - Johnny Stowellman: Getting everything out of Richmond Road onto a truck and into the new place after work wiped the three of us out
09/07/2019, 11:27 - Johnny Stowellman: So we still have shit everywhere

09/07/2019, 11:36 - Reuben Yarwood: Cheers! It was mostly quite basic grammar and vocab, and about 100 kanji
09/07/2019, 11:36 - Reuben Yarwood: The guy next to me was an 8 year old

09/07/2019, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: Which seems unlikely

10/07/2019, 10:08 - Johnny Stowellman: What would Super TiVo even entail ü§î
10/07/2019, 10:08 - +44 7462 872590: It's not a thing
10/07/2019, 10:08 - Johnny Stowellman: I believe in it
10/07/2019, 10:08 - Johnny Stowellman: I picture it as something like Tom Cruise's kit in Minority Report
10/07/2019, 10:08 - +44 7462 872590: And that's all Jesus asks
10/07/2019, 10:09 - +44 7462 872590: It's more like what Netflix was like 5 years ago

27/08/2019, 14:49 - James Kemp: I CANNOT HANDLE THIS HEAT
27/08/2019, 14:49 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs my news
27/08/2019, 14:49 - James Kemp: Met my radio mate for a chat about the podcast idea
27/08/2019, 14:49 - James Kemp: Had some v useful advice
27/08/2019, 14:50 - James Kemp: Apparently he‚Äôs just finished working on a true crime series on Fred and Rose West
27/08/2019, 14:50 - James Kemp: Said it‚Äôs not his bag and pretty grisly but true crime is all the rage right now so his hand was forced üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
27/08/2019, 14:52 - Aaron Ayling: I enjoyed the ITV series "appropriate adult" where Fred West was played by Dominic West
27/08/2019, 14:53 - Reuben Yarwood: Was his advice "make a documentary about Matthew Falder"?
27/08/2019, 14:53 - James Kemp: Apparently some new recordings made by journalists investigating it at the time have just come out

28/08/2019, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: Hahahaha
28/08/2019, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: 10s
28/08/2019, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: Not what they did, just the 'heath being world class trash
30/08/2019, 11:20 - Johnny Stowellman: Possibly dumb question
30/08/2019, 11:20 - Johnny Stowellman: Is coffee less effective after it‚Äôs gone cold?
30/08/2019, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh
30/08/2019, 11:22 - James Kemp: how are we measuring effective
30/08/2019, 11:22 - +44 7752 359588: Don't think so but also don't have any scientific evidence one way or the other!
30/08/2019, 11:22 - James Kemp: it's just as effective if i pour it over your head
30/08/2019, 11:22 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha this is a good question
30/08/2019, 11:22 - James Kemp: actually maybe less, depending on if i want to scald a bitch
30/08/2019, 11:22 - James Kemp: LESS
30/08/2019, 11:24 - Johnny Stowellman: Ahh then measure is it‚Äôs performance as a stimulant for the body
30/08/2019, 11:25 - Johnny Stowellman: Its*
30/08/2019, 11:25 - Johnny Stowellman: I feel far less caffeinated if I let my coffee go cold
30/08/2019, 11:25 - Johnny Stowellman: But I think that might be in my head
30/08/2019, 11:26 - +44 7752 359588: I mean some of coffee is definitely psychological
30/08/2019, 11:26 - Johnny Stowellman: Or maybe it‚Äôs due to me taking longer to drink it, and thus spreading the effect more thinly than drinking all when hot
30/08/2019, 11:26 - +44 7752 359588: Like the smell wakes me up
30/08/2019, 11:26 - +44 7752 359588: And it probably has less of an aroma cold
30/08/2019, 11:30 - James Kemp: I think the answer Johnny actually wanted to this question was cocaine
30/08/2019, 11:52 - Johnny Stowellman: Decoded!
30/08/2019, 11:52 - Johnny Stowellman: ‚ÄúMy coffee is now cold, so may I do a line?‚Äù
30/08/2019, 14:52 - Johnny Stowellman: I can't imagine working on that ¬£100million ad campaign for Brexit right now that Engine are working on
30/08/2019, 14:52 - Johnny Stowellman: It's getting so much industry attention, and you know the planning would be absolutely clueless
30/08/2019, 14:54 - Johnny Stowellman: "Spare a thought for the serfs at Engine and government media agency Manning Gottlieb OMD. Has anyone told them what they‚Äôre doing and when? Whatever it is, it will include weekends."

10/09/2019, 12:50 - James Kemp: basically i'm gonna reach out to non-famous people who were part of queer rights movements (basically all in their 60s+ now), and see if any would be up for being interviewed
10/09/2019, 12:51 - James Kemp: i figure people love talking about themselves, and these people aren't famous so hopefully if i hit up a long list, i can get some bites!
10/09/2019, 12:52 - James Kemp: obv need them to think i'm credible, so i'm putting together a simple website (war flashbacks to my last job...)

13/09/2019, 12:51 - James Kemp: Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought haaaaa
13/09/2019, 12:51 - +44 7752 359588: Inoffensive

24/09/2019, 10:45 - James Kemp: Unlawful not because Bojo was deceitful but unlawful because it prevents Parliament from doing their job for an unnecessary length of time (5 weeks)
24/09/2019, 10:45 - James Kemp: When a queen‚Äôs speech only needs 4-6 days to prepare for
24/09/2019, 10:45 - James Kemp: So they‚Äôre essentially saying there‚Äôs a limit to progrogation and you broke it, bitch
24/09/2019, 10:45 - James Kemp: They held back from inspecting his motive directly
24/09/2019, 10:48 - James Kemp: A unanimous decision too!
24/09/2019, 10:48 - James Kemp: Bercow gets to decide how they reconvene loooooool
24/09/2019, 10:54 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs essentially about as spicy as it could get

24/09/2019, 10:55 - James Kemp: I‚ÄôM EXCITED OKAY

24/09/2019, 13:53 - Reuben Yarwood: So, hey folks, I should let you know that sadly me and Kit are planning on breaking up. The fact that she's going to stay in Tokyo and I'm coming back at Christmas (probably for good now as I hopefully have some work lined up) has forced us to think about the long term and Kit thinks that we have some irreconcilable differences which mean that the relationship doesn't have legs long term. We're still super close, but I have no desire to do the relationship sand timer thing again so I'm moving out of our flat for the last couple of months and we're going to give each other some space and see how it goes. Needless to say I'm really looking forward to sinking a good few pints at Spoons with you all over the holidays!
24/09/2019, 13:56 - James Kemp: Ah mate, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that! Got oodles of time at the moment so fully around for Skypes or whatever you might need. EQUALLY STOKED FOR REUBRETURN!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

24/09/2019, 13:58 - Johnny Stowellman: Sorry to hear that Reubs come home and let‚Äôs get fooked
24/09/2019, 14:00 - Aaron Ayling: As sad as the surrounding sitch is, I am glad to hear you'll be back in a few months and have some work lined up
24/09/2019, 14:01 - +44 7752 359588: I'll say sorry even if it isn't the right thing - break ups suck! Sending lots of love your way, and I hope you do enjoy the rest of your time in japan
24/09/2019, 14:02 - +44 7752 359588: Obvs ready to double park with you at spoons as soon as you are back

09/10/2019, 10:03 - +44 7752 359588: I think it's a bit silly that the media have made her the face of climate activism, but on the whole she seems like a wonderful kid
09/10/2019, 11:09 - James Kemp: yep ^^^^
09/10/2019, 11:09 - James Kemp: basically there is 0 on at work, so i've been loosely tasked with writing a "thought piece" (ew) that we can use in our marketing on the whole youth climate change movement thing
09/10/2019, 11:10 - James Kemp: meant to be quite challenging, etc.
09/10/2019, 11:10 - James Kemp: so just keen to hear what people thought
09/10/2019, 11:14 - +44 7462 872590: She's getting people talking more about climate change. I think sometimes it's easier to put a face on something so people can engage.
09/10/2019, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: She's a total badass. You can quote me if you want
09/10/2019, 11:17 - James Kemp: that's kind of where my head's at - the yoof movement is great at drumming up publicity and gettting attentino, greta's a boss; but also seeing it as a "youth" problem puts the onus on those with the least power to affect actual change (these bitches can't even vote), allows detractors to infantilise the whole problem
09/10/2019, 11:18 - Reuben Yarwood: That's a great point
09/10/2019, 11:18 - James Kemp: so there's gotta be some kinda bridging of the generational gap somewhere

19/11/2019, 11:57 - James Kemp: she managed to squander her lead, hoping the next few weeks see bojo do the same?!
19/11/2019, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: Really wonder why he agreed to one on one
19/11/2019, 11:58 - Aaron Ayling: at least do a David Cameron and only agree if 24 other people are also on stage to distract from you
19/11/2019, 12:01 - James Kemp: arrogance?
19/11/2019, 12:03 - Aaron Ayling: Could very well be - seems like he has a high opinion of himself and probably thinks he's good at debating
19/11/2019, 12:03 - James Kemp: prince andrew stylee
19/11/2019, 12:03 - Aaron Ayling: wheras Jezza is genuinely good at it and comes alive during these sorts of things

19/11/2019, 12:04 - Aaron Ayling: He couldn't have supressed the report into Russian Interference as he was in a Pizza Express
19/11/2019, 12:22 - +44 7462 872590: I remember going to Pizza Express weirdly well because it's a very unusual thing for me to do, as everyone knows I'm a Domino's man.

19/11/2019, 20:36 - Johnny Stowellman: How‚Äôs Jezza been?
19/11/2019, 20:47 - James Kemp: I think he‚Äôs been the better debater!
19/11/2019, 20:47 - James Kemp: Obv I‚Äôm never going to endorse BoJo
19/11/2019, 20:48 - Johnny Stowellman: His supporters in the audience are so obnoxious
19/11/2019, 20:48 - James Kemp: But he‚Äôs overrun a lot, been quite evasive and made it clear he‚Äôs only willing to talk about Brexit in a way which is clearly drawing everyone‚Äôs ire
19/11/2019, 20:48 - Johnny Stowellman: Just picture the Uruk hai from lord of the rings
19/11/2019, 20:48 - James Kemp: Corbyn could‚Äôve gone harder
19/11/2019, 20:49 - Johnny Stowellman: üòé
19/11/2019, 20:50 - James Kemp: Also BoJo just tanked those royal questions
19/11/2019, 20:50 - Johnny Stowellman: Hahahaha, such a tepid audience response for Johnson‚Äôs statement on the monarchy, love it
19/11/2019, 20:55 - Johnny Stowellman: I really don‚Äôt get the commentary on Corbyn being a bit rough around the edges, he smashes it every time I see him speak publicly
19/11/2019, 20:56 - Aaron Ayling: That was a fucking shambles from ITV
19/11/2019, 20:56 - Aaron Ayling: Corbyn came across as someone with a wide platform of ideas but Johnson was better at bullying him about Brexit
19/11/2019, 20:56 - Johnny Stowellman: Gimme the rundown Azza
19/11/2019, 20:57 - Aaron Ayling: Just ITV making them shake hands and edge to be better to each other6
19/11/2019, 20:57 - Aaron Ayling: And joke about what they'd get each other for Christmas
19/11/2019, 20:58 - Johnny Stowellman: Bit unfair they‚Äôre just giving Gove the follow up immediately after
19/11/2019, 20:59 - Johnny Stowellman: Who is this lady?
19/11/2019, 21:01 - Johnny Stowellman: This Sun reporter‚Äôs response is so typical
19/11/2019, 21:02 - Johnny Stowellman: Who do you think won the debate? ‚ÄúNeither. Probs the audience. (Kill em). Mugs.‚Äù
19/11/2019, 21:22 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
19/11/2019, 23:43 - Reuben Yarwood: The whole concept of winning a debate is bull shit though
19/11/2019, 23:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Boris has probably been bullying people down in arguments since he was at Eton debate club
19/11/2019, 23:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Doesn't mean he can run a country
20/11/2019, 09:40 - Aaron Ayling: https://fullfact.org/election-2019/itv-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-debate-fact-checked/

So basically Corbyn wins for being the most honest wheras pretty much all the points Johnson brought up were debatable at best. But no1curr because british public.

As David and Aaron walked up the aisle, Kylie and Jason's 'Especially For You' played during the UK broadcast and the fourth wall was completely shattered. Do Jason and Kylie exist in the Neighbours universe? Are we actually watching Doctor Who? Who even cares?

16/01/2020, 11:34 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm starting a new job on 17th, on a different editing system so need to brush up that weekend and do some tutorials and shit
16/01/2020, 11:34 - Reuben Yarwood: If it's no trouble to anyone could we defer the stag until the following weekend?
16/01/2020, 11:35 - Reuben Yarwood: No worries if not! Just means I won't be going HAM
16/01/2020, 11:37 - Aaron Ayling: üëÅÔ∏è

16/01/2020, 11:48 - Reuben Yarwood: That's the badger
16/01/2020, 11:48 - Aaron Ayling: Just while we're on the subject, found this quote from Winston Churchill:

"Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains ‚Äî all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is affected by the labor and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of these improvements does the land monopolist contribute, and yet, by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced. He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general welfare, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived‚Ä¶The unearned increment on the land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice done."
16/01/2020, 11:52 - Reuben Yarwood: I'll sneak that into the intro to each ep
16/01/2020, 11:52 - Reuben Yarwood: Bet the channel 5 viewers cummmm for Churchill
16/01/2020, 11:57 - +44 7752 359588: I echo this üëÅ

16/01/2020, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: 8th feb is not out of the question, but feels a bit soon for me to plan
16/01/2020, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe 29th feb?
16/01/2020, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: Saucy leap year date?

16/01/2020, 16:59 - +44 7462 872590: I'd prefer the 15th, but can do the 29th.
16/01/2020, 17:00 - Reuben Yarwood: And I'd prefer 29th but can do 15th
16/01/2020, 17:00 - James Kemp: FIGHT
16/01/2020, 17:01 - Reuben Yarwood: First blood wins?
16/01/2020, 17:01 - James Kemp: soggy biscuit
16/01/2020, 17:02 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha, as tempting as both those suggestions are. I'm easy, can do the 29th and Rubens got a better excuse for not doing the 15th.
16/01/2020, 17:06 - Edward Beesley: I'm a 29th-favouring man as well, but can also do either
16/01/2020, 17:11 - Aaron Ayling: 29th wins! @447595390314 would be lovely if you could make it but obv that's a lot of trips to London in quick succession so no huge deal! X x

17/01/2020, 11:34 - James Kemp: I want it known that I am organising a tacky Mr & Mrs quiz for your Hag Do!!
17/01/2020, 11:35 - James Kemp: Maybe I‚Äôll find some erasable whiteboards and we can do it live
17/01/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: (Unless you really hate the idea)
17/01/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: (üòÖ)
17/01/2020, 11:38 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I'm down!
17/01/2020, 11:40 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha no I am down!
17/01/2020, 11:40 - +44 7752 359588: I'm delighted by the idea
17/01/2020, 11:40 - +44 7752 359588: Thanks boo
17/01/2020, 11:43 - Aaron Ayling: As a rough skeleton to the day we figured a cheap brunch all-together somewhere (spoons?) then we 'll split up and do seperate activities for a bit (I just wanna play video/board games) then we can regroup for an eve sesh!
17/01/2020, 11:43 - Aaron Ayling: Basicaly don't want anyone to have to spend much money etc
17/01/2020, 11:44 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
17/01/2020, 11:44 - +44 7462 872590: Sounds like a plan
17/01/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: Liz you can have Dani if you want!!
17/01/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: He‚Äôll be way more down with female fun than games anyway
17/01/2020, 12:02 - Reuben Yarwood: What's the Hen plan?
17/01/2020, 12:10 - Sam Lea: the Schlieff-Hen plan
17/01/2020, 12:30 - Aaron Ayling: Still tbd but "possibly something cliched like a naked life drawing class or something crafty"
17/01/2020, 12:34 - Aaron Ayling: Pine nuts are a severely underrated nut in my view
17/01/2020, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: I want some sort of cheap activity
17/01/2020, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: Need to do some research
17/01/2020, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: Could be brewery based
17/01/2020, 14:54 - Aaron Ayling: OKay guys who's ready for "Posh and Becks are splitting up" round 2?
17/01/2020, 14:55 - Aaron Ayling: Rumours abound that a member of the royal family has died
17/01/2020, 14:55 - Aaron Ayling: Vote on your phones who it is now
17/01/2020, 14:55 - Aaron Ayling: Phil's the obvious choice eh?
17/01/2020, 14:55 - Edward Beesley: This was what my Bloomberg contact's gossip was about a few weeks ago
17/01/2020, 14:56 - Edward Beesley: That Phil was about to die
17/01/2020, 14:56 - Edward Beesley: But then rallied unexpectedly
17/01/2020, 14:56 - Edward Beesley: But they'd prepped for him to die
17/01/2020, 14:59 - Aaron Ayling: ooh
17/01/2020, 14:59 - Aaron Ayling: MULTIPLE SOURCES CONFIRM
17/01/2020, 15:37 - James Kemp: imagine it was andrew
17/01/2020, 15:37 - James Kemp: suicide
17/01/2020, 15:37 - James Kemp: also
17/01/2020, 15:37 - James Kemp: just had another podcast interview
17/01/2020, 15:37 - James Kemp: that was not what i was expecting at all
17/01/2020, 15:38 - James Kemp: interview with two guys from the long yang club - a community club for gay asians set up in the 1980s
17/01/2020, 15:38 - James Kemp: they show up at our flat for the interview
17/01/2020, 15:38 - James Kemp: i open the door
17/01/2020, 15:38 - James Kemp: two white guys standing there
17/01/2020, 15:38 - James Kemp: wtfffff
17/01/2020, 15:48 - +44 7752 359588: WAAAAT
17/01/2020, 15:48 - +44 7752 359588: But wait
17/01/2020, 15:48 - +44 7752 359588: Wat
17/01/2020, 15:49 - James Kemp: i really had to think on my feet
17/01/2020, 15:49 - James Kemp: but giving myself my 10s that i managed to keep them talking for two hours
17/01/2020, 15:49 - James Kemp: if the episode's going to make it, it's going to need significantly broadening out
17/01/2020, 15:50 - James Kemp: because one of them was a bit uncomfortable with pushing the idea of the club as a club 'for asians and their admirers'
17/01/2020, 15:50 - James Kemp: in a way that i could see the other one did not appreciate
17/01/2020, 15:50 - James Kemp: but i think there is an interesting, not fetishist angle - i'm just gonna need to speak to more members
17/01/2020, 15:55 - +44 7752 359588: Oh gross
17/01/2020, 15:56 - +44 7752 359588: So they started a gay asian club so they could pick them up?
17/01/2020, 15:56 - +44 7752 359588: What a world
17/01/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: not quite
17/01/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: the angle is going to now be queer sports clubs
17/01/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: because it's morphed into a badminton club
17/01/2020, 15:56 - +44 7752 359588: Ahhh better
17/01/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: and the nice one of the two is going to interest me to the guy who runs stonewall football club
17/01/2020, 15:56 - +44 7752 359588: That's cute!
17/01/2020, 15:56 - +44 7752 359588: Amazing!
17/01/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: and the journey that the club has been on is quite an interesting parallel with the journey of the queer scene
17/01/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: from communities being built purely based on people's sexualities, to people - now more liberated - finding that being queer alone isn't enough of a thing to necessarily build communities from, and the emergence of queer interest groups to address that
17/01/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: hence the queer badminton part of the community has survived, but the queer social part hasn't
17/01/2020, 15:58 - James Kemp: so going to try and build an episode which explores that with a few other queer sports clubs

21/01/2020, 15:34 - Aaron Ayling: I think I'm (mildly) allergic to either walnuts, pine nuts or sunflower seeds
21/01/2020, 15:34 - Aaron Ayling: Which one do you think it is?
21/01/2020, 15:34 - Aaron Ayling: vote on your phones now
21/01/2020, 15:35 - James Kemp: Tree nut allergy is one of the eight most common food allergies, affecting roughly 0.5 to 1% of the U.S. population. Tree nuts grow on trees, whereas peanuts grow underground and are considered legumes. Tree nuts include almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios and walnuts.
21/01/2020, 15:35 - Aaron Ayling: realised my throat slightly closing up all week is probably related to my eating of them ^
21/01/2020, 15:35 - James Kemp: are they all tree nuts?
21/01/2020, 15:35 - James Kemp: (well sunflower seeds ain't)
21/01/2020, 15:35 - Aaron Ayling: I guessed pine nuts are from pine trees?
21/01/2020, 15:35 - James Kemp: (so it's definitely not that)
21/01/2020, 15:36 - James Kemp: sure
21/01/2020, 15:36 - James Kemp: okay so we've ruled one out
21/01/2020, 15:36 - James Kemp: where now
21/01/2020, 15:36 - Aaron Ayling: (but you can still be allergic to sunflower seeds - it's just less common)
21/01/2020, 15:36 - James Kemp: Pine nuts are generally considered a seed.
21/01/2020, 15:36 - James Kemp: so it's definitely walnuts
21/01/2020, 15:37 - Aaron Ayling: nice will avoid cheers
21/01/2020, 15:39 - James Kemp: the guy i spent the morning with for the research today was such a stoner

Have  listened  to the podcast and really liked it ,  Think i sounded very relaxed and laughing a lot which I think is how I felt during the interview but also talking about serious issues as well . Think your linking sections give it a good structure as well. Will try and hunt out a picture of me from the 80s if I can "
29/01/2020, 10:08 - James Kemp: "Just listened to the podcast and think you've done a terrific job in pulling out essential material from what was probably a lot of meandering by me and by your highlighting key moments in the film's gestation, making and distribution, so you can ignore all points below but I just list them as I wrote them down whilst listening.  I was very glad that Paul's contribution was clear by the way.  There will a tribute afternoon to him at Birkbeck Cinema 15th February afternoon.  If you like I can send you details."

30/01/2020, 10:31 - +44 7752 359588: Just like a dragon dick on a chest üôÉ
30/01/2020, 10:33 - Reuben Yarwood: A symbol of newfound strength  and independence?
30/01/2020, 10:34 - James Kemp: ü§¢
30/01/2020, 10:34 - James Kemp: Get my face
30/01/2020, 10:34 - James Kemp: Tattooed on your face
30/01/2020, 10:36 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
30/01/2020, 10:37 - +44 7752 359588: Haaa
30/01/2020, 10:39 - James Kemp: i know that i'd find something to hate in whatever i ended up getting
30/01/2020, 10:41 - +44 7752 359588: They do say come up with your idea and then wait a year to see
30/01/2020, 11:15 - Reuben Yarwood: This is wise
30/01/2020, 11:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Anyone fancy a climb on Sunday?
30/01/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: not my speed, sorry m8
30/01/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: also dani just got a phone call...
30/01/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: "I had a phone call for the royal revenue saying I had a taxes debt that I had to hold on the line or I would be arrested shortly"
30/01/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: turns out they got the wrong fucking number
30/01/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: looking for someone called david
30/01/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: can you imagine?!
30/01/2020, 11:24 - +44 7752 359588: That's definitely a scam
30/01/2020, 11:24 - James Kemp: either way, i'm glad they got it wrong/backed the fuck off
30/01/2020, 11:24 - +44 7752 359588: No way hmrc calls and threatens arrest
30/01/2020, 11:24 - +44 7752 359588: For sure
30/01/2020, 11:24 - James Kemp: i could see some heavy-handed bailiffs using scare tactics like that
30/01/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: But if a bank or hmrc calls never give them money
30/01/2020, 11:25 - James Kemp: who are contracted by hmrc and would therefore say they are them
30/01/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: It's fine to say that you will ring back their official line to ensure it isn't a scam
30/01/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: That's always the advice given
30/01/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: well i'm just glad it's gone away
30/01/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: he would've shat himself
30/01/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: (understandably)
30/01/2020, 11:28 - +44 7752 359588: Indeed
30/01/2020, 11:28 - +44 7752 359588: Would love a climb at some point, but my elbow is still on rest for now
30/01/2020, 12:10 - James Kemp: feedback from cabaret player on his first episode:
30/01/2020, 12:10 - James Kemp: "I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed, and very flattered, to be the subject of the first episode!    I listened to it before going to bed last night and, needless to say, then couldn‚Äôt sleep and ended up putting the light back on and reading a very dry academic essay on Lorenzo Lotto.   (Andrew could sleep on one leg in a hurricane so no probs there.)    I have no idea whether the podcast is any good or not ‚Äì it‚Äôs just me wittering on‚Äì but I hope other people will find it interesting. üòä"
30/01/2020, 12:10 - James Kemp: I SIMILARLY HAVE NO IDEA
30/01/2020, 12:11 - James Kemp: he's also going to record a fresh recording of one of his songs
30/01/2020, 12:11 - James Kemp: "The other thing is YOU‚ÄôRE STILL THERE at the end.   I love the song but that recording, done at the Pheasantry with full accompaniment of knives on pizza is a bit distracting and I don‚Äôt like the podcast to leave us with misery and self-pity rather than the reconciliation in the third verse.    If I record it for you, probably a bit faster so that I can get all three verses in, would that be OK?"
30/01/2020, 12:12 - +44 7752 359588: Bahahaha
30/01/2020, 12:12 - +44 7752 359588: This man wants to give you all the recordings
30/01/2020, 12:16 - James Kemp: the film director is going to pass his episode onto matt lucas

31/01/2020, 07:58 - Johnny Stowellman: Christ
31/01/2020, 07:58 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently they are in boots and the fire brigade
31/01/2020, 07:59 - +44 7752 359588: I'm assuming no need to be concerned but also wtf
31/01/2020, 08:00 - Reuben Yarwood: From an unknown number??
31/01/2020, 08:00 - +44 7752 359588: Random cell number
31/01/2020, 08:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Well that's disturbing
31/01/2020, 08:02 - Reuben Yarwood: I wonder if they're just spraying out messages to random numbers
31/01/2020, 08:02 - Reuben Yarwood: At least they're not blaming the lizards ü¶é
31/01/2020, 08:03 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah sorry was a pretty big one with work

31/01/2020, 11:24 - +44 7752 359588: And they are discussing whether to quarantine her from the office for a week

31/01/2020, 11:31 - James Kemp: I was genuinely confused when I read it
31/01/2020, 11:37 - Aaron Ayling: Tangential but I enjoyed this comment on  reddit earlier:
31/01/2020, 11:37 - Aaron Ayling: I'm not on Andrew Neil tonight,

You know, my lips don't lie,

And I'm starting to lean to the right , All the attraction, the tension

Don't you see Boris, this is perfection.

31/01/2020, 13:16 - Johnny Stowellman: Who uses Microsoft outlook for work emails?
31/01/2020, 13:18 - Johnny Stowellman: One of the CRM guys here just blew our minds by showing us the creepy analytics dashboard that runs across our MS Suite
31/01/2020, 13:20 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah we do
31/01/2020, 13:20 - Aaron Ayling: I get emailed that as a personal report
31/01/2020, 13:20 - Aaron Ayling: I respond to my boss on average within 30 minutes
31/01/2020, 13:21 - Aaron Ayling: And then it increases as people decrease in seniority haha

31/01/2020, 13:32 - James Kemp: oooooh i want my emails to read me

31/01/2020, 13:40 - +44 7752 359588: I get "productive minutes"

31/01/2020, 13:41 - +44 7752 359588: Shady
31/01/2020, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: "perhaps life should change when you shoot a man, even justifiably, but I was blind to how complete the transformation would be"
31/01/2020, 15:24 - +44 7752 359588: Actual quote from actual Fulbright applicant

31/01/2020, 15:26 - +44 7752 359588: It kills me because his application is very good
31/01/2020, 15:26 - +44 7752 359588: But he is essentially arguing against police body cams
31/01/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: i mean
31/01/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: i want the t
31/01/2020, 15:26 - +44 7752 359588: So politically I hate him
31/01/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: who'd he shoot
31/01/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: he says shoot, not kill
31/01/2020, 15:27 - +44 7752 359588: He was a police officer and he shot a suspect who pulled what turned out to be a game gun
31/01/2020, 15:27 - +44 7752 359588: Did not kill
31/01/2020, 15:27 - +44 7752 359588: But it was one of the first police shootings to be captured by body cam
31/01/2020, 15:27 - +44 7752 359588: And he's clearly still salty
31/01/2020, 15:28 - +44 7752 359588: I mean it sounds like as legit of a police shooting as you can get
31/01/2020, 15:28 - +44 7752 359588: But still no

05/02/2020, 08:20 - Aaron Ayling: You sending her anything in particular?
05/02/2020, 08:20 - Aaron Ayling: Like your first scheduled ep, or what you consider the "best" one?

05/02/2020, 08:20 - James Kemp: ü§ûüèª
05/02/2020, 08:22 - Aaron Ayling: That teaser ep has paid off eh?
05/02/2020, 08:24 - James Kemp: Here‚Äôs hoping!
05/02/2020, 08:24 - James Kemp: This bitch is also a judge at the british podcast awards

05/02/2020, 09:38 - James Kemp: okay, guardian podcast lady latest
05/02/2020, 09:38 - James Kemp: "Honestly, just put it out - you shouldn‚Äôt let me hold you up. I‚Äôm happy to review something when the series has already started and is a couple of episodes in. I just prefer not to do it when a series is on ep 572, as that just looks a bit crap. And if I think I can review, I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs sometime this month."
05/02/2020, 09:38 - James Kemp: these journalists don't mince they WORDS
05/02/2020, 09:39 - James Kemp: good she's gonna get a review out this month if she think she can, and i can still launch this friday
05/02/2020, 09:43 - Aaron Ayling: Sweet! Sounds like a fair approach to that
05/02/2020, 09:44 - James Kemp: basically i was like 'bitch i don't wanna delay but i can if it's the difference between getting a review and not'
05/02/2020, 09:44 - James Kemp: so happy that i can still (possibly) get the best of both worlds
05/02/2020, 09:44 - James Kemp: ü§ûüèª
05/02/2020, 10:34 - +44 7752 359588: Quote from personal statement:  I found ways to entertain myself, whether daydreaming, debating with my parents and sister, or spanking my papa as he huffed and puffed up the Boulder hills"
05/02/2020, 10:34 - +44 7752 359588: In reference to biking with his parents
05/02/2020, 10:36 - Aaron Ayling: hahahaha phrasing
05/02/2020, 10:39 - +44 7752 359588: Just whyyyy would you ever phrase it that way
05/02/2020, 10:51 - Reuben Yarwood: SPANKING MY PAPA
05/02/2020, 10:51 - Reuben Yarwood: SPUNKING MY MAMA
05/02/2020, 10:53 - +44 7752 359588: Also spanking someone as a phrase is not a widely used one
05/02/2020, 11:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Do they mean beating, as in winning a race?
05/02/2020, 11:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Or like "joshing" with?
05/02/2020, 11:48 - Reuben Yarwood: I can only picture someone riding past and slapping their dad on the arse
05/02/2020, 11:48 - +44 7752 359588: I thiiiiink so

05/02/2020, 16:40 - Johnny Stowellman: Was he your best interviewee to date?
05/02/2020, 16:41 - James Kemp: he was the most podcast friendly
05/02/2020, 16:41 - James Kemp: in that he knew how to _perform_
05/02/2020, 16:42 - James Kemp: unsurprisingly
05/02/2020, 16:46 - Reuben Yarwood: It's really engaging man. I actually can't really think of any editing/technical feedback because I was so absorbed in his story, so that tells it all really!
05/02/2020, 16:54 - James Kemp: ah mate
05/02/2020, 16:54 - James Kemp: wait til you get to a more boring espiode

06/02/2020, 11:18 - Aaron Ayling: A little too weasely for me I think
06/02/2020, 11:19 - Aaron Ayling: Looks like someone you would cast when you wanted a "normal" looking guy, like in the US office
06/02/2020, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: That's very cute Jim
06/02/2020, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: And sweet that he's also in on the guardian stuff and excited about it
06/02/2020, 11:20 - Reuben Yarwood: Although "nice young man", I mean, do nice young men do MD on a school night?
06/02/2020, 11:21 - James Kemp: IDENTITIES ARE COMPLEX THINGS, REUBEN
06/02/2020, 11:21 - James Kemp: I CAN BE BOTH
06/02/2020, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: No
06/02/2020, 11:22 - +44 7752 359588: But of the Democratic candidates he's probs top 3 for would you do him?

06/02/2020, 11:24 - James Kemp: ew no
06/02/2020, 11:24 - +44 7752 359588: And Eric swalwell (who has since dropped) was fit in a frat boy way
06/02/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: He's better than Pete!!
06/02/2020, 11:25 - James Kemp: eric is also a no
06/02/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: Oh also Beto O'Rourke sucks, but was also a bit fit

06/02/2020, 11:25 - James Kemp: too all-american
06/02/2020, 11:25 - James Kemp: BETO ALSO NO NO
06/02/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: Thats what does it for me
06/02/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: these men are all messy
06/02/2020, 11:26 - +44 7752 359588: I mean none of them are super hot
06/02/2020, 11:26 - +44 7752 359588: But I would ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
06/02/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: if i had to, it'd probably be eric
06/02/2020, 11:26 - Aaron Ayling: Fun fact - that actor is from New Zealand!
06/02/2020, 11:27 - James Kemp: ahaha

06/02/2020, 11:27 - Aaron Ayling: YOU'RE WRONG
06/02/2020, 11:27 - Aaron Ayling: (wasn't disagreeing that he looks all-american though)
06/02/2020, 11:29 - Aaron Ayling: what is your answer?
06/02/2020, 11:29 - James Kemp: ummm

06/02/2020, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: As is o'rourke
06/02/2020, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: Basically they're all dicjs
06/02/2020, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: Dicks
06/02/2020, 11:31 - James Kemp: dicjs
06/02/2020, 11:32 - +44 7752 359588: I genuinely think the only redeeming thing about Pete is that he is gay
06/02/2020, 11:32 - Aaron Ayling: How far we've come as a society
06/02/2020, 11:32 - Aaron Ayling: He's shit BUT he's gay!
06/02/2020, 11:33 - Aaron Ayling: he's super centrist, right?
06/02/2020, 11:33 - Aaron Ayling: Done pretty well out of Iowa, but will he keep up that momentum you reckon?

06/02/2020, 11:34 - +44 7752 359588: And has like no relevant experience
06/02/2020, 11:34 - James Kemp: wait, you hope he will keep up the momentum??
06/02/2020, 11:34 - James Kemp: i was surprised how hard biden got bummed

14/02/2020, 12:41 - Johnny Stowellman: how are you using on the nose here?
14/02/2020, 12:42 - Johnny Stowellman: because I recently found out i've been using that phrase incorrectly for years, and want to know if I'm the only one

12/03/2020, 19:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Is Polly CGI?
13/03/2020, 09:50 - Aaron Ayling: Sup guys - so with all the Coronavirus developments recently Liz and I have decided to cancel the wedding, we're afraid.

Liz's best mate and her cousin aren't allowed to come because of their jobs, my parents are worried about being let back into America plus there's a significant health risk flying a bunch of 60+ relatives over here where London is forecasted to get it very badly in the next 3 weeks. Plus there's a chance gatherings/weddings will be banned anyway so we'd rather just knock it on the head now and stop worrying about it for the next month

Obviously we're really sorry for having to cancel and are really gutted ourselves as we were v much looking forward to a blowout with you all.

We're still going to try and get legally married, but hopefully you'll understand us not wanting anyone there while we do it - having only our London mates attend will really hammer home how many people we wanted there are missing, so we'd rather go the whole hog and have no one. Obviously we need two witnesses to make it legal - TBC but please don't read anything into who these are (we'd have no one if possible!).

That said we will 100% have a delayed celebration at some point down the line. The theme will be Post-Apocalypse Realness.

13/03/2020, 09:52 - Reuben Yarwood: Still very sad to hear though, unlucky guys!
13/03/2020, 10:39 - Aaron Ayling: It's a sucky sitch but if all we have to worry about in this crisis is our wedding we're doing a lot better than some people
13/03/2020, 10:39 - Aaron Ayling: Just feels like a relief to have decided something tbh

Here are some key points:

Anyone who lives with someone who has a cough or a temperature should stay at home for 14 days
People should start working from home where they possibly can
Avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues
Only use the NHS when we really need to
From tomorrow government will no longer be "supporting" mass gatherings using emergency workers

17/03/2020, 12:56 - Johnny Stowellman: Also a personal announcement: The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs has requested all Australians abroad come home now, in preparation for a full travel ban. It's unknown how long they'd keep the ban for, which might run over my visa period, so most likely I'll be leaving the UK by Friday

17/03/2020, 13:00 - Aaron Ayling: it's basically a case of "decide where you wanna be hunkering down for the next 2 months"
17/03/2020, 13:02 - Johnny Stowellman: Yeah it's a really hard call :(

26/03/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: me and a colleague spent all day yesterday doing a marxist reinterpretation of her hits
26/03/2020, 11:24 - James Kemp: was hit me baby one more time really a critique of the addictive power of capitalism?

I'm a slave 4 u can also be read as an analysis of power relations between working class and bourgeoisie


overprotected is her playing back the american right‚Äôs criticism of universal healthcare in order to show how hollow it is, and that we really need a better socialist infrastructure


get naked (i got a plan) about her initiating a socialist textile revolution, moving to a property-free state where we all pool and share our clothes


oops i did it again is CLEARLY a confessional track about her succumbing to the temptations of capitalism

how the fuck did we miss ‚Äúwork bitch‚Äù as britney‚Äôs anthem for the proletariat?


perhaps we could read til the world ends as a marxist critique of war? as a never-ending game of middle class governments conscripting working class men and women to fight
26/03/2020, 11:24 - James Kemp: ^ highlights
26/03/2020, 11:25 - Aaron Ayling: > I'm a slave 4 u can also be read as an analysis of power relations between working class and bourgeoisie

I was planning to be more organised but work is busy and my evenings seem to have been busy too! In short, I'm planning to provide several rounds of questions, but if anyone else fancies contributing a themed round (say 10 qs?) as guest host, that would be great. We can come to some arrangement about points...

Unless someone has lots of time this afternoon I don't think we'll use the website that @447866230971 suggested and just do it the old fashioned way...

27/03/2020, 19:30 - James Kemp: To discuss answers
27/03/2020, 19:30 - James Kemp: Or is that too fucking much
27/03/2020, 19:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Hmm. I guess we'll have to discuss here?
27/03/2020, 19:31 - Reuben Yarwood: @447595390314 how does Matt do his?
27/03/2020, 19:33 - Sam Lea: Depends how many of us there are likely to be - there were about 50 or so in that one, so the etiquette was keep mic muted unless requested
27/03/2020, 19:33 - Reuben Yarwood: So teams were made up of households?
27/03/2020, 19:33 - James Kemp: Yeah maybe we just need to do household teams

27/03/2020, 19:36 - James Kemp: If it‚Äôs like 15, having a 6 person team might be waste
27/03/2020, 19:36 - Reuben Yarwood: Won't be that many
27/03/2020, 19:36 - James Kemp: 50% of people on the same team üòÖ
27/03/2020, 19:38 - James Kemp: Maybe we split off into smaller WhatsApp teams??
27/03/2020, 19:38 - James Kemp: Sam/Reubs, Me/Dani, Aaron/Liz etc??

02/04/2020, 23:19 - +61 474 759 280: Hopefully it'll be something fun to look back on, and not a precursor to a new normal

03/04/2020, 13:29 - James Kemp: just had our junior (who's also been furloughed) message me and ask me if i want to continue the volunteer project we were doing pre-furlough
03/04/2020, 13:29 - James Kemp: (to help some charity with their launch roadmap)
03/04/2020, 13:29 - James Kemp: had to politely tell him that no, i don't
03/04/2020, 13:32 - +44 7752 359588: Bahahaha
03/04/2020, 13:32 - +44 7752 359588: I mean you don't need to be doing free PR work for them
03/04/2020, 13:33 - James Kemp: also a 2 hour virtual workshop next week
03/04/2020, 13:33 - James Kemp: so ma'am
03/04/2020, 13:33 - James Kemp: *no
03/04/2020, 14:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Okay, need some advice guys
03/04/2020, 14:48 - James Kemp: JUST DRUG 'ER
03/04/2020, 14:48 - Reuben Yarwood: üëåüèª
03/04/2020, 14:49 - Reuben Yarwood: So I was due to live in the warehouse exactly 2 months. I left shortly before 1 month.
03/04/2020, 14:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Didn't sign any contract or anything, just a verbal agreement with the person I sublet off
03/04/2020, 14:50 - Reuben Yarwood: I paid 1st month obviously in full
03/04/2020, 14:50 - Reuben Yarwood: I've also paid 50 quid towards bills this month
03/04/2020, 14:51 - Reuben Yarwood: They now want me to pay half my rent, towards paying a guys deposit back who they're kicking out
03/04/2020, 14:51 - Reuben Yarwood: As "I'm the only one who's working"
03/04/2020, 14:51 - James Kemp: well i don't think who pays should be determined by that, first of all
03/04/2020, 14:51 - Aaron Ayling: 100% ^
03/04/2020, 14:52 - James Kemp: what exactly are they askiing?
03/04/2020, 14:52 - James Kemp: i'm confused
03/04/2020, 14:52 - Aaron Ayling: basically they want Reuben to pay for his second month
03/04/2020, 14:52 - Aaron Ayling: even though he won't be using it
03/04/2020, 14:52 - +44 7752 359588: I mean isn't all your stuff still there?
03/04/2020, 14:52 - Aaron Ayling: and he hasn't signed a contract - they were (illegally?) subletting
03/04/2020, 14:52 - +44 7752 359588: So you technically are still occupying and probably need to pay?
03/04/2020, 14:52 - Aaron Ayling: but yeah, complicated by the fact his stuff is there
03/04/2020, 14:53 - Reuben Yarwood: It is a bit confusing. They've kicked this guy out so they're returning his deposit but they don't have the money themselves
03/04/2020, 14:53 - James Kemp: when's the payment due, on the normal calendar of when you pay?
03/04/2020, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: Great question
03/04/2020, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: ALO
03/04/2020, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: ALSO
03/04/2020, 14:53 - James Kemp: it sounds like you've discharged your current payment duties?
03/04/2020, 14:53 - Reuben Yarwood: I do have a couple of suitcases and some bedding there yeah
03/04/2020, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: Who spent all the deposit money?????
03/04/2020, 14:53 - James Kemp: and you can pay next month's next month?
03/04/2020, 14:53 - Reuben Yarwood: Last day of the month
03/04/2020, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: That is not how this shit works
03/04/2020, 14:54 - James Kemp: so basically they want next month's payment a month early?
03/04/2020, 14:54 - +44 7752 359588: Deposits are meant to be held
03/04/2020, 14:54 - James Kemp: yeah right?!
03/04/2020, 14:54 - James Kemp: am guessing they snorted/injected it all
03/04/2020, 14:54 - James Kemp: if it's this, they get a firm no
03/04/2020, 14:54 - +44 7462 872590: Getting back the deposit should be his problem
03/04/2020, 14:54 - James Kemp: you've paid your rent as agreed
03/04/2020, 14:54 - James Kemp: you're not paying earlier to cover their mismanagement
03/04/2020, 14:55 - Reuben Yarwood: Sorry that's for the following month. So they want half this month's rent. Although they're not planning to pay rent this month. None of them have paid anything. Decision pending
03/04/2020, 14:55 - Aaron Ayling: also this
03/04/2020, 14:55 - James Kemp: yeah i'm really fucking confused
03/04/2020, 14:55 - +44 7752 359588: Duuude what
03/04/2020, 14:55 - Reuben Yarwood: The issue is I agreed to stay for two months
03/04/2020, 14:55 - James Kemp: so they want 1.5x rent or 0.5x rent?
03/04/2020, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: So then definitely no
03/04/2020, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: If they aren't paying rent
03/04/2020, 14:56 - James Kemp: yeah tell them to fuck off
03/04/2020, 14:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah that's my thinking
03/04/2020, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: Also I hope you left nothing valuable there tho
03/04/2020, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: Because they seem shady af
03/04/2020, 14:56 - James Kemp: "sorry guys, i want to support you all, but it sounds like this is a problem of you're own doing, and it's not my job to bail you out"
03/04/2020, 14:56 - James Kemp: maybe a bit harshly phrased
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: this
03/04/2020, 14:57 - Reuben Yarwood: I basically left as if I would never be going back. Only left stuff I wouldn't hate to lose
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: okay fine
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: then set those bridges aflame
03/04/2020, 14:57 - Aaron Ayling: a) if they'r e not paying rent, asking you to pay is cheeky
b) deposits should be securely held by the landlord - why are they dishing out the deposit?
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: more than cheeky, it's feckin RUDE
03/04/2020, 14:57 - Aaron Ayling: agree
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: don't give them a penny, m8
03/04/2020, 14:57 - Reuben Yarwood: üî•üî•üî•
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: what's more, tell them you ain't paying for next mont either
03/04/2020, 14:57 - James Kemp: and run
03/04/2020, 14:58 - James Kemp: and then demand they pay YOU for wasting your time
03/04/2020, 14:58 - James Kemp: you got benches to press
03/04/2020, 14:58 - Reuben Yarwood: Loool
03/04/2020, 14:58 - Reuben Yarwood: COUNTER SUE
03/04/2020, 14:59 - James Kemp: these junkies sound like they fried their damn minds
03/04/2020, 14:59 - Aaron Ayling: i vote this
03/04/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: i'd chuck in a bonus fake sob story too - not that they deserve it, just to make them feel guilty
03/04/2020, 15:01 - +44 7752 359588: Just don't get stabbed if you go back for anything
03/04/2020, 15:01 - +44 7752 359588: Truuuue
03/04/2020, 15:01 - Reuben Yarwood: I asked him what they would do if the rent was frozen, like would they give the ¬£325 back
03/04/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: "yes i'm earning a wage, but it's currently having to go on supporting a family who are all out of work at the moment"
03/04/2020, 15:01 - Aaron Ayling: and also also they're going to be using your "rent" money to pay a deposit - the landlord won't see a penny of it, and they'll tell him that you're not paying rent either
03/04/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: just as long as you do not give them a PENNY, reuben
03/04/2020, 15:01 - Reuben Yarwood: My seventeen kids and two grandkids
03/04/2020, 15:01 - +44 7752 359588: And you will never get that money back

03/04/2020, 15:07 - James Kemp: aaron/liz you giving us 1 each?????
03/04/2020, 15:08 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
03/04/2020, 15:08 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds like I'm basically loaning them money to pay this guy's deposit back.
03/04/2020, 15:09 - James Kemp: nope
03/04/2020, 15:09 - James Kemp: hold firm, mate
03/04/2020, 15:09 - James Kemp: don't give them shit
03/04/2020, 15:09 - James Kemp: engage fake sob story
03/04/2020, 15:10 - Reuben Yarwood: I did leave my suit shoes from the wedding and a guitar. Probably with 200 quid tbh, would be good to get them back
03/04/2020, 15:10 - Reuben Yarwood: *worth
03/04/2020, 15:10 - James Kemp: i still wouldn't
03/04/2020, 15:11 - James Kemp: it's gonna be a level to stoop if they start fucking up your shit
03/04/2020, 15:13 - +44 7752 359588: Is the stabby one going?
03/04/2020, 15:13 - James Kemp: you're subletting - tell them to go to the girl whose room it actually is
03/04/2020, 15:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah he's off back to Scotland
03/04/2020, 15:13 - +44 7752 359588: I would be super ballsy and ask where the actual deposit is???
03/04/2020, 15:13 - +44 7752 359588: Who spent it???
03/04/2020, 15:14 - +44 7752 359588: Well he seemed most likely to fuck up your shit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
03/04/2020, 15:14 - Reuben Yarwood: She's been on lockdown in Lombardy for months. Bit of a shit show really, none of them are earning. Two people on lockdown abroad.
03/04/2020, 15:14 - Reuben Yarwood: There's no way they're paying rent
03/04/2020, 15:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah I just asked that actually
03/04/2020, 15:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah true!
03/04/2020, 15:16 - Reuben Yarwood: 75% sure they spent it on coke
03/04/2020, 15:16 - +44 7752 359588: Of course
03/04/2020, 15:16 - +44 7752 359588: I mean you'll never see that money again
03/04/2020, 15:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah for sure. I'm just going to say that if he keeps insisting
03/04/2020, 15:18 - James Kemp: he has no right to insist on anything, mate
03/04/2020, 15:18 - James Kemp: this is their fuckup and you don't owe them anything
03/04/2020, 15:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Cheers for the support üçª
03/04/2020, 15:20 - Reuben Yarwood: Was just wondering if agreeing on that extra month and bailing was putting me in the wrong here
03/04/2020, 15:21 - Reuben Yarwood: But worst case scenario if they have to pay rent for this month I could pay my part.
03/04/2020, 15:21 - Reuben Yarwood: But only if and when6
03/04/2020, 15:21 - James Kemp: i mean, your moral compass has kicked in way earlier in a situation where it is not necessary to have; whereas theirs is yet to kick in, when it sounds like it should have months ago
03/04/2020, 15:21 - James Kemp: no moral equivalence here
03/04/2020, 15:21 - James Kemp: COMPUTER SAYS: CONSCIENCE CLEAN
03/04/2020, 15:22 - Reuben Yarwood: üëçüèª
03/04/2020, 15:45 - Reuben Yarwood: Okay, apparently the next person pays you the deposit when you leave. And that room is now empty
03/04/2020, 15:58 - James Kemp: LOL
03/04/2020, 15:58 - James Kemp: they whipping a wild card on yo ass
03/04/2020, 15:59 - James Kemp: "oh yeah btw you have this fat financial obligation we didn't tell you about which can be enacted at any time!!!"
03/04/2020, 16:00 - +44 7752 359588: That is not how that works
03/04/2020, 16:00 - +44 7752 359588: Shady af
03/04/2020, 16:26 - Aaron Ayling: (yes we're doing a quiz round each Jim)
03/04/2020, 16:41 - Aaron Ayling: We also got Zoom Pro for the time being so we'll host!
03/04/2020, 16:41 - Aaron Ayling: won't keep getting kicked etc
03/04/2020, 16:51 - Sam Lea: so does that mean a 30 point round is now _more_ acceptable, or still not...? üòÖ
03/04/2020, 16:58 - Aaron Ayling: Hey if you want to deliver a 30 point round that you will then not be eligible for, which then means you will be at a severe disadvantage, that's fine by me!
03/04/2020, 16:58 - Aaron Ayling: _it's the taking part, innit?_
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Sam Lea: while obviously _lol_ , if my round's 5 questions, it's going to be extremely short
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Sam Lea: and posso a lil unrewarding
03/04/2020, 17:02 - Aaron Ayling: Each Q is worth 0.166666666 points?
03/04/2020, 17:02 - Sam Lea: Sounds good
03/04/2020, 17:03 - Sam Lea: tbh I can bring it down to 20
03/04/2020, 17:03 - Sam Lea: so each point is a cool 0.25
03/04/2020, 17:04 - Aaron Ayling: My round has 2 clues to each question. If you get it after the first clue - a whole point. If you get it after the second then half a point.
03/04/2020, 17:04 - Aaron Ayling: Sounds good
03/04/2020, 17:17 - James Kemp: See my round is very amenable to be split also
03/04/2020, 17:18 - James Kemp: So each question has two parts, I was only asking for 1
03/04/2020, 17:18 - James Kemp: But in light of the above
03/04/2020, 17:18 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll ask for both and do a half point for each!
03/04/2020, 17:18 - James Kemp: I will update my slides accordingly ü§ì

03/04/2020, 18:32 - James Kemp: if anyone was chipping anything else in, it wouldn't be so triggering
03/04/2020, 18:32 - James Kemp: but it sounds like nobody is, or has any intention to
03/04/2020, 18:32 - James Kemp: and they're just looking to you
03/04/2020, 18:33 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>

03/04/2020, 18:36 - James Kemp: yeah, you reap what you sow, boo boo
03/04/2020, 18:42 - Reuben Yarwood: I think they're all chipping in a bit but God knows
03/04/2020, 18:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Basically figuring out how much I would pay to get my stuff back without it being awkward haha
03/04/2020, 18:46 - James Kemp: no more than ¬£100 surely
03/04/2020, 18:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah sounds about right

05/04/2020, 04:33 - +61 474 759 280: It looks like a total train-wreck, apparently it was the follow-up to Donnie Darko
05/04/2020, 08:37 - +44 7462 872590: I've not seen it, but yeah the guy that made Donnie  Darko basically ended his career just as it started with this. SAD.

18/04/2020, 13:57 - +61 474 759 280: Because the zombies acquire extra troops every round they stay on the board
18/04/2020, 13:58 - +61 474 759 280: So someone needs to regularly take one for the team otherwise you all get wiped out
18/04/2020, 13:58 - +61 474 759 280: And they seem to prey on the weakest player
18/04/2020, 14:15 - +44 7462 872590: Sorry I missed this. I'd be keen for the next one.

22/04/2020, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: In exciting COVID news, Charlie Brroker's going to do a virus-wipe
22/04/2020, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/bbc-two-comedy
22/04/2020, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: For the first time since the Bafta-winning 2016 Wipe, Charlie Brooker (picture above, courtesy of Matt Holyoak) has been lured out of isolation, to go into isolation for the one-off Charlie Brooker's Antiviral Wipe (w/t) (1x30').

Charlie will be taking a typically sharp look at life in lockdown, in a show made during lockdown. As well as coverage of the crisis itself, he'll also be looking at the things people are watching and doing to keep themselves occupied. The show will also feature Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) with her own very special brand of in-depth reporting, alongside Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell) and other contributors who haven't been told they're doing it yet, but have no good excuse not to.
22/04/2020, 09:47 - Reuben Yarwood: and further down:

Charlie Brooker says: ‚ÄúThe BBC asked me to supply a quote for the press release, which is what you‚Äôre reading now."

02/05/2020, 14:29 - James Kemp: you need to send me a youtube link of your entry from your selected country; ideally, i want their eurovision performance rather than a music video; the entry has to be that country's finalist for any eurovision year; it's okay if they only made it to the semi-finals, as long as they were their country's submission
02/05/2020, 14:30 - James Kemp: only send videos to me - i won't open them, i'll just compile them in a list for easy streaming on the evening

08/05/2020, 12:29 - James Kemp: Less anime and more kinda like idk Star Wars?
08/05/2020, 12:29 - +61 474 759 280: I think the other other one I played was FF9

08/05/2020, 12:30 - +61 474 759 280: bit but*

08/05/2020, 12:31 - +61 474 759 280: The plot was nowhere near as good
08/05/2020, 12:32 - +61 474 759 280: (as 7's)
08/05/2020, 12:39 - +61 474 759 280: How's your course going Jim?
08/05/2020, 12:51 - James Kemp: Good, mate!!

08/05/2020, 12:52 - +61 474 759 280: _Good_
08/05/2020, 12:53 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah good just got through the week on quantitative analysis
08/05/2020, 12:56 - +61 474 759 280: Because I‚Äôm insecure with my maths skills (entrenched school trauma) I over committed to the coursework, but as a result it turned out to be my best week test-wise so far
08/05/2020, 12:58 - +61 474 759 280: Also contested one test question‚Äôs answer and was vindicated.
08/05/2020, 12:58 - +61 474 759 280: So, cop that LSE
08/05/2020, 13:01 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh well done

08/05/2020, 13:12 - James Kemp: Not a true Welshman, surely - *Alun
08/05/2020, 13:13 - +61 474 759 280: Yup! Weekly multi choice quiz and short answer test, then a report at some point
08/05/2020, 13:13 - James Kemp: Get it, girl!
08/05/2020, 13:13 - +61 474 759 280: Work/course/FF7 is keeping my brain sufficiently distracted from the fact that I am back living with my folks
08/05/2020, 13:13 - +61 474 759 280: Mostly at least
08/05/2020, 13:14 - +44 7462 872590: How longs the course for?
08/05/2020, 13:14 - James Kemp: Oh yeah I need at least 700 projects to flit between to feel like I have a purpose
08/05/2020, 13:14 - James Kemp: Even then, it‚Äôs shaky
08/05/2020, 13:14 - +61 474 759 280: 10 weeks
08/05/2020, 13:14 - +61 474 759 280: It was supposed to distract me during unemployment
08/05/2020, 13:15 - +61 474 759 280: Instead is timed perfectly alongside my short-term freelance gig, but whatevs
08/05/2020, 13:15 - +44 7462 872590: üòé
08/05/2020, 13:15 - James Kemp: You gonna be able to join Eurovision btw??

08/05/2020, 13:17 - James Kemp: Then I‚Äôll intro it accordingly
08/05/2020, 13:17 - +44 7752 359588: We could share the playlist early maybe and johnny could still vote?
08/05/2020, 13:18 - James Kemp: Yes!
08/05/2020, 13:18 - James Kemp: If you are keen, I will do this also
08/05/2020, 13:18 - +61 474 759 280: "This is from our friend in Australia!" - has a Eurovision feel to it

08/05/2020, 13:23 - +61 474 759 280: Added it in 2007 and it's still there
08/05/2020, 13:23 - +61 474 759 280: It was some local suburb tea between some shitty neighbours
08/05/2020, 13:24 - +61 474 759 280: And I documented the drama
08/05/2020, 13:24 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>

08/05/2020, 14:17 - +44 7462 872590: I'm in for poker. I've played a bit.

23/05/2020, 10:07 - Sam Lea: What was that business where Ed and I had big standing armies in North America of more or less equivalent size and he tried it on and routed me, even though I should have had defender's advantage
23/05/2020, 10:07 - Sam Lea: Because basically
23/05/2020, 10:07 - Sam Lea: I'm not having that

23/05/2020, 10:16 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I think it was "true random"
23/05/2020, 10:16 - Aaron Ayling: And defenders only have the advantage if the attacker is attacking with an equal number of armies
23/05/2020, 10:16 - Aaron Ayling: Otherwise the attacker has a sliiight advantage, as he attacks with 3,and the defender defends with 2
23/05/2020, 10:17 - Aaron Ayling: I think you just got got with the luck of the dice that time
23/05/2020, 10:17 - Aaron Ayling: Basically it simulated a lot of "3v2"battles to which Ed came out the Victor in a majority of them

24/05/2020, 08:07 - +61 474 759 280: I think it‚Äôs an early round objective, then you have to start looking at player KOs

07/07/2020, 08:39 - +61 474 759 280: Box of 12 different craft beers every month for ¬£25
07/07/2020, 08:39 - +61 474 759 280: Can‚Äôt argue with that
07/07/2020, 11:28 - Sam Lea: guys
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: What would be your answer to this
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: The scenario:
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: Michelle gets up early on Wednesday morning and gets in her car to go to work.
She notices a warning light indiciating low tyre pressure, and inspects her car to find her front driver-side tyre is completely flat.
She calls a colleague who offers to give her a lift to work, as it is on their way.

She calls Fix-It, a local car repair service, who inform her they can perform any repairs today if she can bring the car to their workshop. Alternatively, a workman can be sent out to repair her car, but they normally require 2 working days notice. After explaining that she cannot get the car to them, and that she has no one to help her get into work over the coming days, they agree to
send out a workman to her today.
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: The question:
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: Michelle lied to Fix-It about not having anyone to help her get to work
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: Possible answers:
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: - Yes
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: - No
07/07/2020, 11:29 - Sam Lea: - Cannot say
07/07/2020, 11:30 - Sam Lea: Caveat: Only use information as described in the scenario
07/07/2020, 11:32 - James Kemp: cannot say
07/07/2020, 11:32 - +61 474 759 280: No
07/07/2020, 11:32 - James Kemp: she got a lift once, doesn't mean she can get it twice, but it MIGHT
07/07/2020, 11:32 - Sam Lea: So I said cannot say
07/07/2020, 11:32 - Sam Lea: On those grounds
07/07/2020, 11:32 - James Kemp: hence she might have lied, she might have not
07/07/2020, 11:33 - James Kemp: also she might just feel awkward about asking again
07/07/2020, 11:33 - James Kemp: which would mean she wasn't lying
07/07/2020, 11:33 - James Kemp: BUT SHE MIGHT NOT
07/07/2020, 11:33 - Sam Lea: The colleague may or may not be able to give her a lift on subsequent days, depending on circumstances not mentioned in the scenario
07/07/2020, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: I said she hasn‚Äôt lied on those grounds
07/07/2020, 11:33 - James Kemp: yeah i back your choice, sam
07/07/2020, 11:34 - James Kemp: ain't got enough info in the q alone, IMHO
07/07/2020, 11:34 - +61 474 759 280: She hasn‚Äôt lied because she hasn‚Äôt secured transportation ‚Äúover the coming days‚Äù
07/07/2020, 11:34 - +61 474 759 280: Just today
07/07/2020, 11:34 - +61 474 759 280: ?
07/07/2020, 11:34 - James Kemp: but she might have?
07/07/2020, 11:34 - Sam Lea: But that's also not mentioned
07/07/2020, 11:34 - James Kemp: we don't know that
07/07/2020, 11:34 - +44 7462 872590: The fact that she has some to give her a lift to work is irrelevant. She cannot get the car to Fix It so they have to come and get it.
07/07/2020, 11:35 - James Kemp: "cannot say" is always such a dick option
07/07/2020, 11:35 - +61 474 759 280: Wait so what‚Äôs the answer?
07/07/2020, 11:35 - James Kemp: cannot say!
07/07/2020, 11:35 - James Kemp: iMHO
07/07/2020, 11:35 - Sam Lea: Don't know for certain, Johnny üòÖ
07/07/2020, 11:36 - +61 474 759 280: What is happening
07/07/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: what if her colleague DIED
07/07/2020, 11:36 - Sam Lea: It was just on a test I applied for, for which I was told to set aside c. 45 minutes
07/07/2020, 11:36 - Sam Lea: But it only lasted about 30
07/07/2020, 11:36 - +61 474 759 280: Oooh
07/07/2020, 11:36 - Sam Lea: Every other answer I was extremely confident I had the right answer
07/07/2020, 11:36 - +61 474 759 280: When will you know the answer?
07/07/2020, 11:36 - Sam Lea: But this one was the last one I did
07/07/2020, 11:37 - Sam Lea: And I felt the test was giving me shade ending so early
07/07/2020, 11:37 - Sam Lea: And I am _para_
07/07/2020, 11:37 - James Kemp: you are 100% right with this one
07/07/2020, 11:37 - James Kemp: and i second that
07/07/2020, 11:37 - Sam Lea: next 48 hours, apparently... so I'll keep you updated
07/07/2020, 11:37 - Sam Lea: _t o   b e   c o n t i n u e d _
07/07/2020, 11:38 - James Kemp: i love the shade
07/07/2020, 11:38 - James Kemp: "Michelle is a lying BITCH"
07/07/2020, 11:38 - James Kemp: true or false
07/07/2020, 11:39 - +44 7462 872590: For me the phrase "over the coming days" does not suggest she is talking about today. So I would say she hasn't lied.
07/07/2020, 11:40 - James Kemp: if you got all the others bang on, even if this one _is_ wrong, that's surely a pass
07/07/2020, 11:40 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah defo
07/07/2020, 11:43 - Aaron Ayling: Also would go for "cannot say"
07/07/2020, 11:44 - Aaron Ayling: But quickly skimming it I was like "Michelle's lying"
07/07/2020, 11:44 - +44 7752 359588: I am also a cannot say voter
07/07/2020, 11:45 - +44 7752 359588: Is this for a job?
07/07/2020, 11:45 - Aaron Ayling: Changed my mind on a thorough read
07/07/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: flat 51 consensus
07/07/2020, 11:45 - Aaron Ayling: Auto correct really desperate to change the to thoroughbred
07/07/2020, 12:36 - +61 474 759 280: Started volunteering at a food bank today
07/07/2020, 12:36 - +61 474 759 280: Which, as someone who‚Äôs unemployed, I‚Äôm also entitled to free meals at, it turns out
07/07/2020, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice one man
07/07/2020, 12:37 - +61 474 759 280: (They let the volunteers eat there free anyway, but still)
07/07/2020, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: How's the grub?
07/07/2020, 12:38 - +61 474 759 280: Decent!

07/07/2020, 17:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Fucking karma

09/07/2020, 16:56 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm guessing the order from earliest to latest atm is:

09/07/2020, 16:58 - +61 474 759 280: Standard is about 2:30am for me atm, any earlier feels pointless. But that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm unemployed rn. Usually I‚Äôd be 11.30-12

09/07/2020, 16:59 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs a slippery slope at 12.30

20/07/2020, 10:07 - James Kemp: Sun is shining so it‚Äôs beer garden x 2!
20/07/2020, 10:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Fab. Both excellent choices
20/07/2020, 15:25 - +61 474 759 280: Think I'm going to foster a cat
20/07/2020, 15:25 - +61 474 759 280: What're people's instincts on that?
20/07/2020, 15:25 - +61 474 759 280: Could I be making a huge mistake? It'd only be for a couple of months
20/07/2020, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: I mean that's the kind of shit I would do if I didn't have Aaron reminding me that I would never be able to give the cat up
20/07/2020, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: So basically do you have it in you to let it go
20/07/2020, 15:40 - +61 474 759 280: Oh definitely
20/07/2020, 15:40 - +61 474 759 280: Hope that doesn‚Äôt make me a monster in your eyes, but yes definitely could

21/07/2020, 08:47 - +61 474 759 280: And yeah you can basically read their bios online and choose the cat specifically
21/07/2020, 10:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Cats can have anxiety medication! Who knew?
21/07/2020, 10:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Kit's cat had diabetes - I wouldn't fancy doing the daily injections
21/07/2020, 10:07 - Reuben Yarwood: But giving it a lot of love and chucking some powder in its food sounds doable. Could even sprinkle a bit in your cereal
21/07/2020, 10:07 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm assuming it's like kitty ket
21/07/2020, 10:17 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah that upset me last night when I first learnt that

23/07/2020, 09:28 - +44 7752 359588: I'm intrigued by I May Destroy You, but thought it might be too dark for me given the concept
23/07/2020, 09:28 - +44 7752 359588: Thoughts?
23/07/2020, 09:37 - Reuben Yarwood: The first few episodes are particularly harrowing. If I'd ever been a victim of sexual assault I absolutely wouldn't watch it
23/07/2020, 09:38 - Reuben Yarwood: But there are a lot of funny moments, particularly later on. The genius of it is that it can pivot between the two often

24/07/2020, 14:01 - +44 7752 359588: Also when was that gun last used, the English civil war?
24/07/2020, 14:02 - Reuben Yarwood: It's an Arabic rifle, you have to put gunpowder in it and tamp it down then put the bullet in
24/07/2020, 14:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Probs not been used for a wee while
24/07/2020, 14:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe the crusades??

24/07/2020, 14:03 - +44 7752 359588: So like why did your dad get a gun?
24/07/2020, 14:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Okay they didn't have guns in the crusades. Apparently used around the 1850s.
24/07/2020, 14:05 - Reuben Yarwood: His mate gave it him
24/07/2020, 14:05 - Reuben Yarwood: He's really old and unwell so I guess he's just handing out all his stuff...

25/07/2020, 15:46 - +61 474 759 280: I've been meaning to Google Mariya Takeuchi for years now, this is a good read
25/07/2020, 15:46 - +61 474 759 280: Takeuchi‚Äôs success, however, has long been limited to her home country (save for a few niche audiences devoted to vintage Japanese pop). That changed in 2017 when the internet discovered her 1984 track, ‚ÄúPlastic Love.‚Äù
25/07/2020, 15:47 - +61 474 759 280: The song ‚Äî a galloping, funk-indebted piece of pop whose lyrics harbor a sense of melancholy ‚Äî originally appeared on the album, ‚ÄúVariety.‚Äù In the summer of 2017, a YouTube channel called Plastic Lover shared the track ‚Äî or, more accurately, a seven-minute remix of it. The post featured a photo of Takeuchi that had been taken in Hollywood in 1980, a shot used as the cover for a single titled ‚ÄúSweetest Music‚Äù that was released later that year but cropped in on her smile.
25/07/2020, 15:47 - +61 474 759 280: Since then, ‚ÄúPlastic Love‚Äù has become an online sensation. The Plastic Lover upload currently boasts more than 22 million views. Part of that success can be attributed to YouTube‚Äôs recommendation algorithm, which suggests videos for viewers based on what they think they might like. Many saw Takeuchi‚Äôs beaming face in the list of suggested videos on their right and clicked away.
25/07/2020, 15:47 - +61 474 759 280: Takeuchi now finds herself juggling two musical realities. In Japan, she‚Äôs one of the most famous musicians around. Outside of the country, however, she‚Äôs the creator of an obscure J-pop song that has garnered attention thanks to computer programming and the creation of memes. That said, her story is far more interesting than just being the latest viral surprise.

30/07/2020, 09:58 - +61 474 759 280: Bad Education
30/07/2020, 10:00 - +61 474 759 280: Can anyone suggest something for me?
30/07/2020, 10:03 - +44 7752 359588: All I've watched recently is hallmark original mystery movies about a librarian who's in a murder mystery club
30/07/2020, 10:03 - +44 7752 359588: So probably not your cup of tea haha

30/07/2020, 10:05 - +61 474 759 280: I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm all in on Clint Eastwood but I liked the film
30/07/2020, 10:05 - +44 7752 359588: I think they did the female reporter dirty if I recall, and her family were pretty mad
30/07/2020, 10:05 - +61 474 759 280: Ha
30/07/2020, 10:05 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah, she is a demon in the film

07/08/2020, 14:17 - +44 7752 359588: Probably too seriously

07/08/2020, 14:19 - +44 7752 359588: Also annoyingly, it will possibly only be broadcast on one station
07/08/2020, 14:19 - +44 7752 359588: Unless they let local affiliates host for each state
07/08/2020, 14:19 - Reuben Yarwood: You've got to have someone throwing shade

07/08/2020, 17:12 - Aaron Ayling: In Fuck Marry Kill
07/08/2020, 17:12 - Aaron Ayling: Do you get to have sex with the person you marry?
07/08/2020, 17:12 - Aaron Ayling: I have very strong views about this
07/08/2020, 17:12 - James Kemp: Yes
07/08/2020, 17:12 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs marriage
07/08/2020, 17:13 - James Kemp: I intend to fuck my husband
07/08/2020, 17:13 - +61 474 759 280: Married people usually don‚Äôt have sex so no
07/08/2020, 17:13 - +61 474 759 280: Only christians have sex during marriage now
07/08/2020, 17:13 - +61 474 759 280: These days
07/08/2020, 17:13 - +61 474 759 280: If they‚Äôre lucky
07/08/2020, 17:14 - +61 474 759 280: (Just remembered you guys are married now)
07/08/2020, 17:14 - +61 474 759 280: Lol my bad
07/08/2020, 17:14 - James Kemp: I get the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre meant to provide distinct options‚Äù
07/08/2020, 17:15 - James Kemp: But for me that is 1 time fuck vs live with and fuck for life
07/08/2020, 17:15 - Aaron Ayling: No, it's a hypothetical scenario game where the literal definition of marriage isn't meant to be applied.

There isn't supposed to be an easy choice. You have to balance the desire to fuck someone with the ability to live with them forever,and the decision you make reveals something about you.
07/08/2020, 17:15 - Aaron Ayling: But "1 time fuck" just makes that choice completely redundant
07/08/2020, 17:15 - Aaron Ayling: It's like "who would you most want to fuck, who do you 2nd most want to fuck, kill" then.
07/08/2020, 17:16 - James Kemp: You got a lot of feelings rn
07/08/2020, 17:17 - Aaron Ayling: Anywho that's my thoughts. I'm just horrified thinking about all the times I've answered this to people with the different rules in their head but to my framework of it, and them judging me based on their interpretation.
07/08/2020, 17:18 - Aaron Ayling: Maybe we all just play snog marry avoid from now on.
07/08/2020, 17:19 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm homebound do you need anything from the shops?

Studies now show that wearing a mask basically means you'll probably still get the virus, but in such a small load ( ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ) that it'll be super mild or asymptomatic and thus lead to a form of immunity
13/08/2020, 10:43 - Aaron Ayling: BUT why the fuck would you choose a picture where the two most prominent people are wearing the mask wrong and thus will get none of the benefits described in the article
13/08/2020, 11:05 - James Kemp: i also feel like a load of dumb dumbs are gonna jump on this
13/08/2020, 11:05 - James Kemp: and be like

13/08/2020, 11:05 - James Kemp: in other words:
13/08/2020, 11:05 - James Kemp: SHAMIMA BEGUM FOR PRIME MINISTER
13/08/2020, 12:04 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah totally.The messaging/theory has always been "it doesn't stop you getting it, but it stops others getting it from you" but whether that actually is what people took on board is another story

26/08/2020, 14:09 - Aaron Ayling: I believe they are frozen, yes
26/08/2020, 14:09 - Aaron Ayling: also is that the worst celebrity endorsement ever?
26/08/2020, 14:09 - James Kemp: Yes
26/08/2020, 14:09 - James Kemp: Am I close?
26/08/2020, 14:09 - James Kemp: Will let others weigh in
26/08/2020, 14:10 - +61 474 759 280: I think it has to be an exclusively UK chain
26/08/2020, 14:10 - +61 474 759 280: Iceland or Tesco
26/08/2020, 14:10 - James Kemp: Looks beneath Tesco
26/08/2020, 14:11 - James Kemp: Londis?
26/08/2020, 14:11 - Aaron Ayling: Is Iceland still "beneath" Tesco these days? I guess they do still have a core of trash kerry katona prawn ring buying consumers, under the new outer coating of hipster vegans and no palm oil.
26/08/2020, 14:11 - James Kemp: I would say so
26/08/2020, 14:12 - James Kemp: Compare the Tesco near us with the Iceland on Mare St
26/08/2020, 14:12 - +61 474 759 280: Oh it‚Äôs going to be fucking Sainsbury‚Äôs, indicating a huge fall in status
26/08/2020, 14:12 - James Kemp: Stab rating is much higher at an Iceland imho
26/08/2020, 14:12 - Aaron Ayling: lock in your vote and I'll reveal in 30 mins or so
26/08/2020, 14:12 - +61 474 759 280: Aaaah
26/08/2020, 14:12 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd give Iceland 4 knives
26/08/2020, 14:12 - +61 474 759 280: Sains
26/08/2020, 14:13 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm going with Londis
26/08/2020, 14:13 - James Kemp: SAINS?!
26/08/2020, 14:13 - James Kemp: That is big risk, big reward
26/08/2020, 14:13 - James Kemp: I like it
26/08/2020, 14:14 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm anticipating it‚Äôs going to be a shock answer
26/08/2020, 14:14 - +44 7752 359588: Going in for asda
26/08/2020, 14:14 - +44 7752 359588: Having never shopped there
26/08/2020, 14:15 - +61 474 759 280: Mrs Browns Boys is fucked up, watched it in Derry at Christmas one year
26/08/2020, 14:15 - Aaron Ayling: Liz likes the Wal-Mart connection there
26/08/2020, 14:15 - Aaron Ayling: Slight tangent but this is a great watch - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwzKGxAwy4A
26/08/2020, 14:15 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like londis is too janky to have this type of exclusive product
26/08/2020, 14:16 - +44 7752 359588: Watch it be m and s üòÇ
26/08/2020, 14:16 - Aaron Ayling: this compares the shit sitcom that the main character of Extras writes, with Mrs Brown's Boys
26/08/2020, 14:16 - +61 474 759 280: This reminds me of that fake ad you found for Cornish pasties Aaron
26/08/2020, 14:16 - Aaron Ayling: no it was a real ad!
26/08/2020, 14:16 - +61 474 759 280: LOL NO
26/08/2020, 14:16 - Aaron Ayling: it was the homepage of the cornish pasty society, rather
26/08/2020, 14:17 - +61 474 759 280: Society?
26/08/2020, 14:17 - +61 474 759 280: So like pasty fandom?
26/08/2020, 14:17 - +61 474 759 280: I think we need the answer btw
26/08/2020, 14:18 - +44 7752 359588: Agreed
26/08/2020, 14:18 - +44 7752 359588: Stop edging everyone
26/08/2020, 14:18 - +61 474 759 280: üëÄ
26/08/2020, 14:18 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 14:18 - +61 474 759 280: Ok confirmed
26/08/2020, 14:19 - +61 474 759 280: Which supermarket was it??
26/08/2020, 14:19 - Aaron Ayling: it was ICELAND
26/08/2020, 14:19 - +61 474 759 280: Aaaah
26/08/2020, 14:19 - Aaron Ayling: The font on the "Ham and Cheese Crowns" bit could have given that away to the discerning viewer
26/08/2020, 14:19 - James Kemp: I AM CLAIMING THAT
26/08/2020, 14:20 - James Kemp: I SAID IT
26/08/2020, 14:20 - +61 474 759 280: Me too
26/08/2020, 14:20 - Aaron Ayling: I mean I said "lock in your answers" so you didn't have 2
26/08/2020, 14:20 - James Kemp: Shhhhh
26/08/2020, 14:25 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 14:26 - +61 474 759 280: Amazing
26/08/2020, 14:29 - Aaron Ayling: actually maybe this is - https://youtu.be/9Vq7U-3r8YU
26/08/2020, 14:31 - +61 474 759 280: Yikes
26/08/2020, 14:53 - +44 7462 872590: üò®
26/08/2020, 14:53 - +44 7462 872590: That's terrifying
27/08/2020, 07:56 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
27/08/2020, 08:04 - +61 474 759 280: Question i‚Äôd like people‚Äôs input on today:
27/08/2020, 08:05 - +61 474 759 280: Which celebrity would make the best relative?
27/08/2020, 08:07 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
27/08/2020, 08:08 - +61 474 759 280: Just think he‚Äôd be great craic at an otherwise dry family affair
27/08/2020, 08:08 - +44 7462 872590: Celebrity? Or fictional character? Which one do we pick?
27/08/2020, 08:09 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôll leave that open, since Tim Allen is Tim Taylor in Tool Time, not playing himself
27/08/2020, 08:10 - +61 474 759 280: (Even though that‚Äôs totally what he‚Äôs like irl, he couldn‚Äôt act that)
27/08/2020, 08:12 - +44 7462 872590: Cause didn't Tim Allen go to prison before he became an actor? Tim Taylor I'm sure has a perfect record.
27/08/2020, 08:13 - +44 7462 872590: Mine in Keanu Reeves. Family member: Godfather.
27/08/2020, 08:13 - +44 7752 359588: I think Tim Allen snuggled a lot of drugs which would just make him an even more fun uncle
27/08/2020, 08:13 - +44 7752 359588: *smuggled
27/08/2020, 08:13 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha
27/08/2020, 08:14 - +44 7752 359588: But he may have snuggled them between some butt cheeks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
27/08/2020, 08:14 - +61 474 759 280: Loooool
27/08/2020, 08:15 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like I would take Rupert grint as like a chill cousin
27/08/2020, 08:15 - +44 7752 359588: Plus he could introduce me to everyone else from Harry potter
27/08/2020, 08:15 - +44 7752 359588: But he seems like he would just smoke weed and drive his ice cream van and I can get behind that
27/08/2020, 08:16 - +44 7752 359588: Equally, I think Lily Tomlin would be a very fun aunt
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +61 474 759 280: This is very on brand for you
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +61 474 759 280: As is this for George
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +44 7462 872590: Tim Allen is the OG Walter White, Johnny is his Jesse Pinkman.
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôve been told I look a lot like Jesse Pinkman
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +44 7462 872590: I'd watch the hell out of that show
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +61 474 759 280: By multiple people
27/08/2020, 08:17 - +61 474 759 280: Including my mum
27/08/2020, 08:18 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ
27/08/2020, 08:21 - +44 7752 359588: Tim Allen was arrested with 650 grams cocaine at the Kalamazoo airport
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +44 7752 359588: But even worse, he is a big old Republican and Trump supporter
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +44 7752 359588: Which to be fair does feel on brand for an uncle
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +61 474 759 280: What a story!
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +61 474 759 280: This doesn‚Äôt surprise me in the slightest
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +44 7752 359588: Also another fun fact
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +44 7752 359588: His real last name is Duck!
27/08/2020, 08:22 - +44 7752 359588: Dick
27/08/2020, 08:23 - +44 7752 359588: Excuse the autocorrect this morning
27/08/2020, 08:23 - +61 474 759 280: Tim Dick?
27/08/2020, 08:23 - +44 7752 359588: Timothy Alan Dick to be precise
27/08/2020, 08:29 - +61 474 759 280: Outstanding
27/08/2020, 10:15 - Reuben Yarwood: It would have to be grumpy uncle Bill Murray
27/08/2020, 10:15 - Reuben Yarwood: This is bonkers
27/08/2020, 10:52 - Aaron Ayling: https://youtu.be/dW0QCU3RPtY
27/08/2020, 10:52 - Aaron Ayling: ^this is pretty spot on
27/08/2020, 10:53 - Aaron Ayling: 3:10 - me every time
27/08/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: Ooh could my relative be Paris Hilton?
27/08/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: She‚Äôd be super fun
27/08/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: Get you into all the parties she DJd
27/08/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: And is fucking iconique
27/08/2020, 11:23 - James Kemp: Loadsa drugs too
27/08/2020, 11:25 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
27/08/2020, 11:25 - +44 7462 872590: Free hotel room wherever you go!
27/08/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: And not as much of an actual wreck as Lindsay
27/08/2020, 11:26 - James Kemp: Which is where my mind first went as a choice
27/08/2020, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: But if you could pick any era Lindsay against any era Paris...?
27/08/2020, 11:35 - James Kemp: Still Paris, I think
27/08/2020, 11:35 - +61 474 759 280: Feel like a John/Jim/Paris/Tim sesh would be heavy
27/08/2020, 11:35 - +61 474 759 280: Oh and is she your sister or cousin or aunt?
27/08/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: Aunt
27/08/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: So she feels a sense of duty to give me shit and show me a good time?
27/08/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: Sister, we‚Äôd fight
27/08/2020, 11:36 - James Kemp: Cousin, cba
27/08/2020, 11:36 - +61 474 759 280: Excellent choice
27/08/2020, 11:37 - James Kemp: She‚Äôd also wanna prove she‚Äôs still young as an aunt, which would propel her into being messier
27/08/2020, 11:37 - +61 474 759 280: Yes!
27/08/2020, 11:37 - +61 474 759 280: Fuck
27/08/2020, 11:37 - +61 474 759 280: She's still only 39
27/08/2020, 11:37 - +61 474 759 280: Younger than Mcauley!
27/08/2020, 11:38 - +61 474 759 280: Macaulay*
27/08/2020, 11:39 - +61 474 759 280: Still works as she's bound to be messy as fuck in her 40s and 50s
27/08/2020, 11:39 - James Kemp: I feel personally targeted
27/08/2020, 11:40 - +61 474 759 280: I meant if she's your aunt we have to age her past 39
27/08/2020, 11:40 - +61 474 759 280: She's Janet's sister
27/08/2020, 11:41 - +61 474 759 280: Pls take my hypothetical as seriously as I am
27/08/2020, 11:41 - James Kemp: Well Janet‚Äôs mum died in 1990
27/08/2020, 11:41 - James Kemp: So surely she could be 39?
27/08/2020, 11:41 - James Kemp: She had one last fuck with a youngun?
27/08/2020, 11:42 - James Kemp: 9 years before she died!
27/08/2020, 11:42 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs plenty feasible!
27/08/2020, 11:43 - +61 474 759 280: in 1990 Richard Hilton was 35..
27/08/2020, 11:43 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah okay why not
27/08/2020, 11:44 - James Kemp: Maybe
27/08/2020, 11:44 - +61 474 759 280: wagwan with Nicky Hilton?
27/08/2020, 11:44 - James Kemp: She‚Äôs the baby who was born when Janet‚Äôs mum got jiggy with a black American solider during WW2
27/08/2020, 11:44 - James Kemp: Baby was never heard of
27/08/2020, 11:44 - James Kemp: Sent you north
27/08/2020, 11:44 - James Kemp: Could it be Paris?
27/08/2020, 11:44 - James Kemp: *up
27/08/2020, 11:45 - +61 474 759 280: Was that a thing?
27/08/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: Yep
27/08/2020, 11:45 - +61 474 759 280: Whoaaaaaaaaa
27/08/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: Family drama
27/08/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: Let‚Äôs just say that baby was Paris Hilton
27/08/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: Case closed
27/08/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: Brb showering

27/08/2020, 12:22 - +61 474 759 280: Don't go there
27/08/2020, 12:22 - Sam Lea: Pretty good price tho, not tempted?
27/08/2020, 12:23 - +61 474 759 280: I read he died so I'm gonna leave it
27/08/2020, 12:24 - Aaron Ayling: I imagine if your algorithm was sentient, Johnny, it would beg for death
27/08/2020, 12:26 - +61 474 759 280: Remember when my Amazon recommended purchases was a bunch of styrofoam heads and duct tape?
27/08/2020, 12:27 - +61 474 759 280: AKA the Ted Bundy purchasing bio
27/08/2020, 12:27 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ù§Ô∏è
27/08/2020, 12:33 - James Kemp: Your algorithm is a cock destroyer
27/08/2020, 12:40 - +44 7462 872590: You did by a bunch of styrofoam heads to be fair. Not giving the algorithm much to work with.
27/08/2020, 12:40 - +44 7462 872590: *buy
27/08/2020, 12:47 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>

27/08/2020, 17:43 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah hit us up that week so we can eye the weather
27/08/2020, 18:09 - Reuben Yarwood: By outside I mean like "outside the house" by the way
27/08/2020, 18:09 - Reuben Yarwood: It's in a bar
27/08/2020, 18:09 - Reuben Yarwood: 93 Feet East
27/08/2020, 18:10 - Reuben Yarwood: That was not clear
27/08/2020, 18:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Anxiety! At The Bar
28/08/2020, 02:26 - James Kemp: Guys you‚Äôre not going to be able to even fathom the level of gross of what I just partook one
28/08/2020, 02:27 - James Kemp: *in
28/08/2020, 02:27 - +61 474 759 280: ????
28/08/2020, 02:27 - James Kemp: Just helped Pascoe spend a ¬£1000 gift certificate at Sketch with only me, him and Dani present
28/08/2020, 02:27 - +61 474 759 280: Lush!
28/08/2020, 02:27 - James Kemp: But also
28/08/2020, 02:28 - James Kemp: Hell
28/08/2020, 02:28 - +61 474 759 280: Explain
28/08/2020, 02:28 - James Kemp: I went to the toilet and got welcomed back to the table three times
28/08/2020, 02:28 - James Kemp: He had a gift certificate to spend and Emily‚Äôs away
28/08/2020, 02:29 - James Kemp: It was great but also
28/08/2020, 02:29 - James Kemp: If I had that much money I would never spend it that way Jesus
28/08/2020, 02:29 - +61 474 759 280: I picture it's a 1920s aesthetic and the waiters offer plates of lines of cocaine with drink refills
28/08/2020, 02:30 - +61 474 759 280: Of course but if you have a friend that's of that world just lean into it
28/08/2020, 02:30 - James Kemp: I know but also Dani has no job and he felt so weird about it
28/08/2020, 02:30 - +61 474 759 280: It's simultaneously repulsive and great for you guys

They provide every person born in the U.K. between Sept. 1, 2002, and Jan. 1, 2011, with a tax-free windfall to start their adult lives.

The 18-year-olds will have access to account balances that range from about 1,000 pounds

03/09/2020, 13:07 - +61 474 759 280: They were bought by Blackstone and their social media managers have gone down swinging on Instagram
03/09/2020, 13:07 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha, damn. They were always too expensive anyway
03/09/2020, 13:08 - Aaron Ayling: Doesn't Australia try to claim the Flat White? (apologies if this is wrong). And thus can't you say any country with a coffee machine etc. Also shrimps and barbies etc. etc.

03/09/2020, 13:16 - +44 7752 359588: Not really
03/09/2020, 13:16 - +44 7752 359588: Like chips didn't really exist in 1776
03/09/2020, 13:17 - +44 7752 359588: And I would argue the fish and chips as a meal is made by the presence of chunky chips and peas

04/09/2020, 11:06 - +44 7752 359588: V weird
04/09/2020, 11:07 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like Johnny would particularly enjoy it

04/09/2020, 13:55 - +61 474 759 280: A ‚Äòbaker‚Äô being what QAnon fans call themselves, because they follow breadcrumbs from Q üë®üèº‚Äçüç≥
04/09/2020, 14:10 - Aaron Ayling: Ah yes, the profession the famously follows breadcrumbs, the Baker.
04/09/2020, 14:10 - Aaron Ayling: That*
04/09/2020, 14:10 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs a poetic interpretation
04/09/2020, 14:11 - Aaron Ayling: At least go for something like Hansels or summit
04/09/2020, 14:12 - +61 474 759 280: It actually gives the game away a bit too, suggesting that they‚Äôre making up their own creations

07/09/2020, 14:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds great. But can't do this weekend
07/09/2020, 14:53 - Sam Lea: Dyou think there's a way to host a voice chat that the host can mute between emergency meetings?
07/09/2020, 14:54 - Sam Lea: As in, mute everyone for everyone
07/09/2020, 14:54 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah Zoom cna do that
07/09/2020, 14:54 - Aaron Ayling: I think
07/09/2020, 14:54 - Sam Lea: Or is the limitation of the text chat extra spicy
07/09/2020, 14:54 - Aaron Ayling: But we can just be gentlemanly and not speak between meetings?
07/09/2020, 14:54 - Aaron Ayling: Nah I'd say have the voice discussions

07/09/2020, 17:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Apparently it was misrepresented though
07/09/2020, 17:32 - Reuben Yarwood: "In response to Netflix‚Äôs actions, Ma√Ømouna has received death threats and called ‚Äúa paedophile‚Äù. A petition is still circulating to cancel its release. When you know Ma√Ømouna‚Äôs previous work, you‚Äôll know this condemnation is unfair; she is a brilliant and thorough director who put in plenty of research to create a nuanced project. The poster and trailer were misguided choices from Netflix and it is horrific to see the difference in treatment between her, a young black filmmaker, in comparison to some famous French directors who are actually known for sexual misconduct (think Roman Polanski who won Best Director at the C√©sars in February). "
07/09/2020, 17:32 - James Kemp: people fucking suck
07/09/2020, 17:33 - Reuben Yarwood: Fucking capitalists

09/09/2020, 06:47 - +61 474 759 280: One thing that scared me about Among Us is the number of Blue Lives Matter, Pepes, and Trump fans that are on the North American server
09/09/2020, 06:48 - +61 474 759 280: If it‚Äôs at all indicative of broader America we‚Äôre all doomed
09/09/2020, 07:48 - Aaron Ayling: I think it's more indicative of Gamer‚Ñ¢ culture
09/09/2020, 07:49 - Aaron Ayling: The game is very popular on Twitch right now, so I reckon a lot of people who watch twitch will be playing

10/09/2020, 15:40 - +61 474 759 280: Half the email I‚Äôve got is about managing stress levels, so I think it‚Äôs going to be pretty intense
10/09/2020, 15:41 - +61 474 759 280: Also said to make sure I switch off on the four days off
10/09/2020, 15:41 - +44 7752 359588: Oh jeez
10/09/2020, 15:41 - +61 474 759 280: Makes sense I guess, we‚Äôve got a pretty hectic lockdown roadmap between now and Christmas
10/09/2020, 15:42 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like I saw some headline saying orgies were allowed under your lockdown rules

11/09/2020, 10:23 - +44 7752 359588: Nah, my dad used to stay up late and watch it when I was little
11/09/2020, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: The episodes have a pretty broad spectrum of spookiness
11/09/2020, 10:24 - +44 7752 359588: And to me it is associated with waking up in the night, trying to go back to sleep and instead watching a show about alien abductions, which did nothing to lull me to sleep
11/09/2020, 10:24 - +44 7752 359588: So it might be scarier in my mind than it is in real life
11/09/2020, 10:24 - +44 7752 359588: I think a saw the golem episode and it freaked me out too

11/09/2020, 12:35 - +44 7462 872590: Hauntingly beautiful. The original Blade Runner was set in 2019, so pretty accurate then.
11/09/2020, 12:44 - Sam Lea: An homage, a tribute, an aspiration. A statement of intent.

12/09/2020, 08:34 - +61 474 759 280: I don't think any Australian would ever be so in love with their party leader that they'd put his/her name on their boat
12/09/2020, 08:34 - +61 474 759 280: I could be wrong

23/09/2020, 15:53 - +44 7752 359588: The letting agent did tell us having us in the flat during viewings would make it less attractive, but maybe reuben on the couch would add to the value
23/09/2020, 15:53 - James Kemp: as his lease isn't up til mid jan
23/09/2020, 15:54 - James Kemp: LOL like we give a shit

23/09/2020, 15:55 - +44 7752 359588: We should leave shits in the toilet for every viewing
23/09/2020, 15:55 - James Kemp: i have 0 interest in whether or not this place sells
23/09/2020, 15:55 - Reuben Yarwood: In the bath
23/09/2020, 15:55 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe just on the floors

23/09/2020, 15:56 - +44 7752 359588: But genuinely I do think he'll try to kick us out every time
23/09/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: let's blaze the fuck up just before they arrive
23/09/2020, 15:56 - James Kemp: i hope the cunts outside are throwing a tuesday afternoon rager

23/09/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: i'll probably be out then anyway
23/09/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: but i want him to know
23/09/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: that i am out of my own accord
23/09/2020, 15:57 - +44 7752 359588: Please leave a shit anyways
23/09/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: i will clarify that if i see him
23/09/2020, 15:57 - James Kemp: just so he knows
23/09/2020, 15:58 - +44 7752 359588: I want money off the rent for the shenanigans
23/09/2020, 15:58 - +44 7752 359588: And for the shading
23/09/2020, 15:58 - +44 7752 359588: If anything my burping presence should raise the value
23/09/2020, 15:58 - James Kemp: exactly!

I think it‚Äôs going to be a tough couple of months because I‚Äôm still in lockdown and living on my own so I can‚Äôt easily see anyone, and my social network here‚Äôs somewhat deteriorated a bit due to me fucking off to London for almost half a decade. Tomorrow‚Äôs my last day at work then I‚Äôm off for four days, and I‚Äôd really like to catch up with you all with 1-1 calls when you‚Äôre free, it‚Äôd mean a lot
26/09/2020, 12:57 - James Kemp: Aw mate damn I‚Äôm sorry - of course around all day, every day

26/09/2020, 13:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Such a hard time for this to happen
26/09/2020, 13:06 - +44 7752 359588: Oh johnny I'm so sorry - I can't imagine. Definitely down for chatting or just nonsense games or netflix to take the mind off things
26/09/2020, 13:28 - +44 7462 872590: So sorry to hear that John. I'm definitely up for some nonsense games and Netflix watch a longs. Free anytime.
26/09/2020, 13:34 - Sam Lea: On hand to chat / game / whatever might be useful, whenever suits you big man. Sad to hear this.

30/09/2020, 11:22 - +61 474 759 280: They‚Äôre comedians, Clarke died last year just around the corner from my home

01/10/2020, 22:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Anyone seen Little Fires Everywhere?
01/10/2020, 22:36 - Reuben Yarwood: V. good show about motherhood/privilege and it's set in the 90s so lots of good nostalgia value

02/10/2020, 07:44 - +44 7752 359588: I find the real twist in trump having covid is that melania has it too. Implying she was actually physically close enough to him to get it at some point
02/10/2020, 07:44 - +61 474 759 280: They stood next to each other after the debate
02/10/2020, 07:45 - +61 474 759 280: Which made me think, will Joe have it too now?
02/10/2020, 07:47 - +44 7752 359588: I think Joe was masked up when he wasnt talking
02/10/2020, 07:48 - +44 7752 359588: So hopefully no
02/10/2020, 07:48 - +44 7752 359588: Man what if trump dies
02/10/2020, 07:48 - +44 7752 359588: What a year this would be
02/10/2020, 07:48 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúC‚Äômon Jack‚Äù

02/10/2020, 07:48 - +61 474 759 280: The phrase of 2020
02/10/2020, 07:48 - +44 7752 359588: But I like entertaining the possibility
02/10/2020, 07:49 - +61 474 759 280: I really don‚Äôt want him to be a martyr in the Covid wars
02/10/2020, 07:49 - +61 474 759 280: Just severely crippled
02/10/2020, 07:50 - +61 474 759 280: Let‚Äôs see him drink a glass of water after _this_
02/10/2020, 07:50 - +44 7462 872590: If Trump goes... Mike Pence is President for a bit. Fucking hell.
02/10/2020, 07:51 - +61 474 759 280: He wouldn‚Äôt do much in a month (would he?)
02/10/2020, 07:52 - +44 7462 872590: But would the election still go ahead
02/10/2020, 07:52 - +44 7462 872590: They would try and move back, the republicans
02/10/2020, 07:59 - James Kemp: Am I too jaded for thinking this is all some calculated move?
02/10/2020, 07:59 - James Kemp: Potentially disrupt an ejection he knows he‚Äôs set to lose?
02/10/2020, 07:59 - James Kemp: Or at least avoid another debate
02/10/2020, 08:00 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah this pinged to me too

02/10/2020, 08:01 - Aaron Ayling: Th e other danger is that he gets it really mildly and then thinks its basically nothing and tells all his base that

02/10/2020, 10:57 - Aaron Ayling: I'm down!
02/10/2020, 10:59 - Aaron Ayling: I want to try the variant game mode:

1 imposter who has 50% vision
Crewmates have 100% vision
Imposter immediately announces who they are.
Crewmates always skip votes and can only win by completing all their tasks.
Imposter (obviously) is trying to find everyone and kill them before they finish their tasks.
02/10/2020, 11:02 - Sam Lea: i don't _not_ like the sound of that, let me put it that way ;)

02/10/2020, 12:48 - +61 474 759 280: I think at the start they were completely denying covid but have come around to it a bit

03/10/2020, 09:49 - +61 474 759 280: (I never really got that idea)
03/10/2020, 10:38 - Aaron Ayling: I'm pretty sure he just had a science briefing with some standard facts  and then regurgitated what he was told when he went off script at event.
03/10/2020, 10:38 - Aaron Ayling: So he was probably told that on a surface the virus is killed by UV light or bleach (like any cell)
03/10/2020, 10:38 - Aaron Ayling: And then he just started rambling about how we should use that in the body somehow

12/10/2020, 09:52 - +44 7462 872590: The bitch is back!

12/10/2020, 11:12 - +44 7752 359588: Do you know how long they get to be away for?
12/10/2020, 11:12 - James Kemp: yeah i'm not on any of their projects, so no idea what chaos will be happening there
12/10/2020, 11:12 - James Kemp: i imagine some
12/10/2020, 11:13 - James Kemp: i think one guy is off for a month, and another girl is off for at least this week, if not longer
12/10/2020, 11:14 - +44 7752 359588: I'm just imagining saying this at my work - I feel like the answer would be no
12/10/2020, 11:15 - +44 7752 359588: Even though they chat a lot of shit about mental health
12/10/2020, 11:15 - +44 7752 359588: But it basically takes the form of "bring a healthy snack in to share! Wellbeing!'

12/10/2020, 11:24 - James Kemp: also, not to victim blame here, but the girl who's had to take time off would constantly complain about having too much, yet still put her hand up to take on more work
12/10/2020, 11:25 - James Kemp: whereas i put my hand up for NOTHING
12/10/2020, 11:25 - +44 7752 359588: This is 100% the right way forward

21/10/2020, 13:05 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs up there with the chairman of ML accidentally texting ‚Äúhorny‚Äù in our work chat
21/10/2020, 13:05 - +44 7462 872590: ü§Æ
21/10/2020, 13:06 - +61 474 759 280: Well it‚Äôs way above that, but I‚Äôll never forget horny-gate
21/10/2020, 13:06 - James Kemp: surely next debate is going to be...
21/10/2020, 13:06 - James Kemp: they're muting the mics and counting interruptions against their time, right?
21/10/2020, 13:06 - James Kemp: trump is going to have 0 time left to speak
21/10/2020, 13:06 - James Kemp: even when it's his time
21/10/2020, 13:07 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs going to work
21/10/2020, 13:07 - James Kemp: if you're biden, surely you just prang him from the get-go by using the word 'smart'
21/10/2020, 13:07 - James Kemp: he'll rage into forfeiting all his time
21/10/2020, 13:08 - +61 474 759 280: Such mullarkey
21/10/2020, 13:13 - +44 7752 359588: This is wild
21/10/2020, 13:13 - James Kemp: Also Hunter
21/10/2020, 13:13 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd definitely suck his dick for a baggie
21/10/2020, 13:15 - +44 7752 359588: I do sooooort of feel for mr wanker
21/10/2020, 13:15 - +44 7752 359588: Like he was just trying to multitask on a long call
21/10/2020, 13:15 - James Kemp: There‚Äôs a time and a place!!
21/10/2020, 13:15 - +44 7752 359588: I live in fear of the day I'm not muted and they can hear me dicking around on reddit on boring staff calls
21/10/2020, 13:16 - +44 7752 359588: I mean, yes I don't think I'd be down to wank off on a work call
21/10/2020, 13:16 - James Kemp: Is this what you‚Äôve been doing when you close your bedroom door on all those calls, Liz?
21/10/2020, 13:16 - James Kemp: Beaning it
21/10/2020, 13:16 - +44 7752 359588: But I can sort of see how it happens when you've been in zoom calls forever and are bored hahaah
21/10/2020, 13:16 - Reuben Yarwood: There's dicking around and there's _dicking around_
21/10/2020, 13:16 - +44 7752 359588: üôÉ
21/10/2020, 13:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Like ideally you dick around without your dick exposed
21/10/2020, 13:17 - Reuben Yarwood: On camera
21/10/2020, 13:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Who's this with? Good idea!
21/10/2020, 13:19 - +61 474 759 280: Even though I know the camera‚Äôs on, I‚Äôm for some reason way more prone to rolling my eyes and screwing up my face when someone says something dumb in meetings
21/10/2020, 13:20 - James Kemp: Trump and Biden!
21/10/2020, 13:20 - +44 7752 359588: Oh that's a vibe
21/10/2020, 13:20 - +44 7752 359588: In recent hiring interviews, my face has betrayed everything
21/10/2020, 13:20 - +61 474 759 280: (Compared to real world meetings that is)
21/10/2020, 13:21 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 13:21 - Reuben Yarwood: I have to turn my camera off
21/10/2020, 13:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Otherwise I'm just watching my own face trying not to do anything weird
21/10/2020, 13:22 - +61 474 759 280: Haha yes, _that‚Äôs_ why he was exercising cultural sensitivity and tact
21/10/2020, 13:22 - James Kemp: Don‚Äôt get Otto‚Äôd!!
21/10/2020, 13:24 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think that's a job I would take, but man is it a convo starter
21/10/2020, 13:25 - +61 474 759 280: For sure
21/10/2020, 13:25 - James Kemp: Surely part of you is tempted, Johnny?
21/10/2020, 13:25 - James Kemp: The polsub fantasy
21/10/2020, 13:25 - +61 474 759 280: Although it would have precluded me from getting a UK visa
21/10/2020, 13:26 - +61 474 759 280: I was very close to going for a holiday during my time in japan
21/10/2020, 13:26 - +61 474 759 280: But a couple of weeks before cash was due they blew up a South Korean sub and we thought war was going to break out
21/10/2020, 13:27 - +61 474 759 280: So I, uh, changed my mind about that little venture
21/10/2020, 13:27 - James Kemp: A sub?
21/10/2020, 13:27 - +61 474 759 280: Submarine?
21/10/2020, 13:27 - James Kemp: üòè
21/10/2020, 13:27 - +61 474 759 280: Or just a little sub
21/10/2020, 13:27 - +61 474 759 280: Poor fella
21/10/2020, 13:27 - Edward Beesley: Has anyone else watched the bbc doc that's on iplayer at the moment  called "The Mole - infiltrating North Korea"
21/10/2020, 13:28 - James Kemp: No but I want to
21/10/2020, 13:28 - James Kemp: Worth it??
21/10/2020, 13:29 - Edward Beesley: It's unbelievable. Genuinely couldn't believe it wasn't a kind of 'mockumentary' or dramatised doc. But as far as I can work out it is all totally real
21/10/2020, 13:30 - Edward Beesley: It's quite weirdly put together, but in a way that I enjoyed. Would be interested in your thoughts if you watch
21/10/2020, 13:30 - James Kemp: Will watch!!
21/10/2020, 13:33 - +44 7752 359588: In some ways I'm surprised you haven't actually visited NK johnny
21/10/2020, 13:33 - +44 7752 359588: It's just very on brand
21/10/2020, 13:34 - +44 7752 359588: But equally I am glad you haven't because I reckon you'd be at high risk of being accused of stealing a portrait of some sort of Kim Jong
21/10/2020, 13:36 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúAccused of‚Äù
21/10/2020, 13:36 - James Kemp: I see the dance you‚Äôre dancing
21/10/2020, 13:37 - +44 7752 359588: I mean there's been some claims that otto warmbier never stole anything
21/10/2020, 13:37 - +44 7752 359588: Also I just realised his last name is literally warm beer
21/10/2020, 13:37 - James Kemp: Johnny would do what Otto couldn‚Äôt
21/10/2020, 13:37 - +44 7752 359588: Hahahaha
21/10/2020, 13:37 - James Kemp: I also just realised this!!
21/10/2020, 13:37 - +44 7752 359588: Is alcohol legal in NK?
21/10/2020, 13:37 - James Kemp: Do you reckon if his name was Coldbeer they would‚Äôve let him go?
21/10/2020, 13:40 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
21/10/2020, 13:41 - +61 474 759 280: Should also see Red Tape and Comedy in North Korea

21/10/2020, 13:44 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 13:44 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs led my a documentarian who toured around North Korea under the cover story of being a comedian. he had cerebral palsy, so the North Korean govt thought he was really handy propaganda against the west. He got really incredible access. It‚Äôs this really bitter-sweet narrative
21/10/2020, 13:45 - +61 474 759 280: Ah! Saw this in the bottleo the other day
21/10/2020, 13:45 - +61 474 759 280: We have a done of labels like that
21/10/2020, 13:48 - +44 7752 359588: Interesting

21/10/2020, 14:26 - James Kemp: "include this puss"
21/10/2020, 14:28 - +44 7752 359588: It's less cringe than it could have been, but I still cannot take james corden seriously at all
21/10/2020, 14:30 - +61 474 759 280: They reference this doc in The Mole! The North Koreans bitch him out because they know they got got

22/10/2020, 14:11 - Edward Beesley: Because I'm more au-fait with awful noughties pop-punk than I am with Pitbull, I originally read this as a Fall Out Boy reference and was trying to shoe-horn "Free Lead Capture Organic Discovery" into the end of the chorus of "Sugar Were goin down"
22/10/2020, 14:11 - Edward Beesley: "I'll be your number one with a bullet; Free lead capture organic discovery" almost scans quite well
22/10/2020, 17:47 - James Kemp: Belated LOL

27/10/2020, 23:33 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah they‚Äôve gotta own that
27/10/2020, 23:34 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôll serve a purpose for a time. They will look back on it with regret but for now it‚Äôs doing a job
27/10/2020, 23:35 - +61 474 759 280: Oh wait, I just saw the actual clip. It‚Äôs good!
27/10/2020, 23:35 - +61 474 759 280: I was expecting a full borat impersonation but it‚Äôs tasteful, most people wouldn‚Äôt draw the connection anyway

02/11/2020, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: And how he was apparently a dumbass
02/11/2020, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: But also good at making people feel like a friend

03/11/2020, 09:14 - James Kemp: "Donald Trump has encouraged supporters to "go into the polls and watch very carefully", and Republicans have actively recruited poll watchers to flag votes that could be challenged. Armed paramilitary groups might show up at polling places to "protect" the election."
03/11/2020, 09:14 - James Kemp: i'm sorry but
03/11/2020, 09:15 - James Kemp: "Republicans were long barred from poll watching because they used the tactic in 1981 to intimidate voters, but two years ago a judge lifted that restriction."

03/11/2020, 10:10 - Reuben Yarwood: This is crackpot dictator territory, hopefully he doesn't carry this into contesting the postal vote
03/11/2020, 10:11 - Reuben Yarwood: I guess he'll wait and see how the count goes and if he thinks he has a chance he'll kick off
03/11/2020, 10:11 - James Kemp: ^ that guardian timeline spells out a whole range of options which are terrifying
03/11/2020, 10:11 - James Kemp: seizing votes, getting local senators to pick the winner, etc etc

03/11/2020, 10:56 - +44 7752 359588: I mean democrats straight down the line

03/11/2020, 11:38 - James Kemp: "he boys brought to Pleasure Island transform into donkeys for their misbehavior and are sold to slave labor in the salt mines and circus. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to witness Lampwick transform into a donkey."

04/11/2020, 07:49 - Aaron Ayling: Basically gonna have days of uncertainty now until the postal/early votes get counted.
04/11/2020, 07:49 - James Kemp: Maybe if he wins, you just stay here after all?
04/11/2020, 07:49 - +61 474 759 280: Why do early/postal take longer than votes made on the day?
04/11/2020, 07:50 - +61 474 759 280: Some1 esplain pls
04/11/2020, 07:50 - James Kemp: Because they have to be verified whilst they‚Äôre being counted?

04/11/2020, 07:50 - James Kemp: As in address and identity verified?
04/11/2020, 07:51 - +61 474 759 280: Sou nan da

04/11/2020, 07:53 - James Kemp: Yeah basically more admin on postal votes - e.g. checking address and signature?
04/11/2020, 07:55 - +61 474 759 280: Got it
04/11/2020, 07:56 - +61 474 759 280: Man republicans are just straight up villains huh
04/11/2020, 07:57 - Aaron Ayling: It also varies from state to state too
04/11/2020, 07:58 - Aaron Ayling: So Arizona (I think) has been counting early ballots before today, hence why Fox has cled them going blue already

04/11/2020, 07:58 - Aaron Ayling: Looks like Biden will need 75% of the non counted votes in PA to swing them
04/11/2020, 07:58 - James Kemp: Apparently he‚Äôs got Arizona
04/11/2020, 07:58 - +44 7462 872590: Apparently Trump is ahead in Georgia, but only marginally.
04/11/2020, 07:58 - James Kemp: Biden has
04/11/2020, 07:58 - Aaron Ayling: Which is doable as Dems are really overreoresented in postal votes
04/11/2020, 07:59 - James Kemp: (That‚Äôs what Reddit is saying)
04/11/2020, 07:59 - James Kemp: (Reliable source)
04/11/2020, 07:59 - Aaron Ayling: Fox have called it for Arizona, CNN say its still too early to say

04/11/2020, 08:13 - +61 474 759 280: There was a Democrat commentator on CNN saying they were hoping for this election to be a comprehensive repudiation of Trump in the White House, and while they might still win, that rejection clearly hasn‚Äôt eventuated

10/11/2020, 11:40 - +61 474 759 280: I had a date and she pulled out a spliff half way through. Of course against alI common sense I jumped on board. I think the date went well but then I stonewalled on the goodbye because I had a sudden thought that maybe I was totally misreading the situation.

10/11/2020, 11:53 - +61 474 759 280: Large factor at play for smoking weed though was that I thought it‚Äôd help me sleep tonight, which it 100% will

10/11/2020, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: I just wanted to leave when he did! I wasn't going to creepily stay in the flat all day without him

18/11/2020, 12:55 - Aaron Ayling: Horses kill more Australians than sharks. Do you hate them too? I will accept "yes" as an answer.
18/11/2020, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: It is November 18 and the Christmas music is coming out

19/11/2020, 12:46 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah I liked it but really think it hinges around the Giuliani interview.
19/11/2020, 12:47 - Aaron Ayling: I also liked that as dumb as those MAGA conspiracy fucks were they still just let some random Eastern European they just met live with them
20/11/2020, 07:27 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
20/11/2020, 10:04 - +44 7752 359588: That looks banging

20/11/2020, 10:18 - Aaron Ayling: I think the can was about ¬£6
20/11/2020, 10:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Bit ironic that it was so expensive
20/11/2020, 10:19 - James Kemp: Ha!
20/11/2020, 10:19 - Reuben Yarwood: You'd have to be a billionaire to get a 6 pack am I rite

20/11/2020, 10:21 - James Kemp: Next sum
20/11/2020, 10:21 - Sam Lea: to the tune of Heaven 17's 'Temptation'

20/11/2020, 10:22 - Aaron Ayling: 1.3 cans each
20/11/2020, 10:22 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
20/11/2020, 10:22 - James Kemp: 1.3?!
20/11/2020, 10:22 - James Kemp: Fuck Warren
20/11/2020, 10:22 - James Kemp: Stingy
20/11/2020, 10:22 - Aaron Ayling: and at 7.2% if we all fast for the day we can probably all get fucked up
20/11/2020, 10:23 - James Kemp: Dividing that .3 can globally would be a nightmare
20/11/2020, 10:23 - Aaron Ayling: i think you just give out 4 cans per 3 people?
20/11/2020, 10:23 - Aaron Ayling: tell each group to sort it out themselves
20/11/2020, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: In a pandemic Aaron
20/11/2020, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: Srsly
20/11/2020, 10:24 - Aaron Ayling: shit sorry
20/11/2020, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: Get real
20/11/2020, 10:24 - Aaron Ayling: no bad ideas in a brainstorm Johnny
20/11/2020, 10:24 - James Kemp: How much does he have to invest in canning to resize the can
20/11/2020, 10:24 - James Kemp: So it‚Äôs 1.3 sized
20/11/2020, 10:24 - James Kemp: And does that effect how much we get?
20/11/2020, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: üôèthis is true let‚Äôs keep going
20/11/2020, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: okay
20/11/2020, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: got one for you
20/11/2020, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: the can is 440 mls
20/11/2020, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: 0.3 of a can is 130 mls
20/11/2020, 10:25 - +44 7752 359588: Here for the captain planet memes, and that's all
20/11/2020, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: taking each person's amount up to 570 mls. A pint is 568 mls
20/11/2020, 10:26 - James Kemp: A PINT EACH
20/11/2020, 10:26 - +61 474 759 280: Omg
20/11/2020, 10:26 - James Kemp: Well, just under
20/11/2020, 10:26 - James Kemp: That 2ml would ass up on a global scale
20/11/2020, 10:26 - +61 474 759 280: A stingy pint
20/11/2020, 10:26 - James Kemp: Add, thanks autocorrect
20/11/2020, 10:26 - Aaron Ayling: we skim those 2mls off the top for our efforts organising
20/11/2020, 10:26 - Reuben Yarwood: I was trying to figure out what "Ass Up" meant
20/11/2020, 10:27 - James Kemp: You know ;)
20/11/2020, 10:27 - Sam Lea: that's the way we like to sup
20/11/2020, 10:27 - Aaron Ayling: = 27,464,788 pints for us
20/11/2020, 10:28 - James Kemp: I feel like we should‚Äôve kept some of Warren‚Äôs budget in reserve for the logistics of this
20/11/2020, 10:28 - Aaron Ayling: plus the pints we are legally owed
20/11/2020, 10:28 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds fair
20/11/2020, 10:28 - James Kemp: 100% on the liquid
20/11/2020, 10:28 - Aaron Ayling: 10/10
20/11/2020, 10:28 - James Kemp: How the fuck‚Äôs he getting it to us
20/11/2020, 10:29 - James Kemp: Tbf classic lads, all in on the pints, not a thought to the practicality
20/11/2020, 10:29 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs the vaccine all over again
20/11/2020, 10:29 - +61 474 759 280: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
20/11/2020, 10:29 - Aaron Ayling: we just turn up to a literal country-sized warehouse full of pints like ...fuck
20/11/2020, 10:30 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúWe‚Äù the whole world?!
20/11/2020, 10:30 - James Kemp: Mate the carbon footprint
20/11/2020, 10:30 - James Kemp: Think this through plz
20/11/2020, 10:52 - James Kemp: Guys I just had a shower thought
20/11/2020, 10:53 - James Kemp: I think Warren owes us more than a pint
20/11/2020, 10:53 - James Kemp: @447912940213 - did you factor in those who can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt drink into your global population number?
20/11/2020, 10:53 - +61 474 759 280: Oh shit
20/11/2020, 10:53 - Aaron Ayling: nope
20/11/2020, 10:53 - James Kemp: MORE PINTS!!
20/11/2020, 10:53 - Aaron Ayling: straight up divide by 7.8 billion
20/11/2020, 10:53 - James Kemp: Can u recalculate plz + thx
20/11/2020, 10:55 - +61 474 759 280: But
20/11/2020, 10:56 - +61 474 759 280: 107 million have an alcoholic use disorder
20/11/2020, 10:56 - +61 474 759 280: They NEED more pints
20/11/2020, 10:56 - +61 474 759 280: So
20/11/2020, 10:56 - +61 474 759 280: ???
20/11/2020, 10:56 - James Kemp: Fuelling their unhealthy habits?!
20/11/2020, 10:56 - James Kemp: Certainly not
20/11/2020, 10:56 - James Kemp: Not on my watch
20/11/2020, 10:58 - +61 474 759 280: @447752359588 I didn‚Äôt like this to start with but I forced myself to drink it because it costed $11 and was 8.8%, by the time I was done I LOVED it
20/11/2020, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: $11 beer??? Good lord son
20/11/2020, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: Did it taste better by the end or were you just more lit?
20/11/2020, 12:11 - +61 474 759 280: BOTH

20/11/2020, 13:19 - +44 7462 872590: You couldn't make it up
20/11/2020, 16:15 - +44 7752 359588: So I assume no one in this chat watches Supernatural
20/11/2020, 16:15 - +44 7752 359588: I also don't watch supernatural
20/11/2020, 16:15 - +44 7752 359588: But I have been deeply amused by this revelation (and the fact that it was covered in the Daily Mail): https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8932047/Misha-Collins-confirms-Destiel-canon-Supernatural.html
20/11/2020, 16:16 - +44 7752 359588: Basically, for 11 years, fans on the internet have been shipping two male characters... and then right before the show ends... THE SHIP BECOMES CANON
20/11/2020, 16:16 - +44 7752 359588: AND THEN THAT CHARACTER GOES TO SUPER HELL FOREVER
20/11/2020, 16:16 - +44 7752 359588: It's been a wild ride
20/11/2020, 16:17 - +44 7752 359588: I just had to share
20/11/2020, 16:17 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like it is the most homophobic gay ending they could give the fans
20/11/2020, 16:28 - Reuben Yarwood: That is so outrageous
20/11/2020, 16:29 - Reuben Yarwood: You like that do you?? WELL NOW HE'S DEAD
20/11/2020, 16:29 - Aaron Ayling: And in super hell forever
20/11/2020, 16:35 - +44 7752 359588: I've been reading about it on social media and the take is basically that the creators of Supernatural have always been a bit uncomfortable that the fan base is just all women and not manly men, even though that is the only reason that show lasted 15 years. So, basically you get what you want, but not really because this a show about men fighting shit and not feelings
20/11/2020, 16:35 - +44 7752 359588: Also the other character dies in the finale
20/11/2020, 16:35 - +44 7752 359588: It's incredibly rude. But I am fascinated by the trend of fan ships becoming canon these days
20/11/2020, 16:36 - +44 7752 359588: I think it may have also happened in the Legend of Korra? Again right before someone dies.
20/11/2020, 16:36 - +44 7752 359588: Welcome to my ted talk on gay ships, fandom and the canon. I'm here all night.
20/11/2020, 16:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Which two Harry Potter characters would you ship?
20/11/2020, 16:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Ooh better one - which LOTR/Harry Potter crossover would you ship?
20/11/2020, 16:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Eg. Hagrid / Shelob
20/11/2020, 16:41 - +44 7752 359588: I mean there is only one answer to this and it is obviously Sirius/Remus and I will never hear anything else
20/11/2020, 16:41 - +44 7752 359588: This is harder... is it Tom Bombadil/Hagrid?
20/11/2020, 16:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Tom Bobmadil would be a gentle lover
20/11/2020, 16:43 - Reuben Yarwood: He'd sing you a merry tune while you fucked
20/11/2020, 16:46 - +44 7752 359588: Speaking of - this was on /r/dataisbeautiful the other day and it really tickled me
20/11/2020, 16:46 - +44 7752 359588: https://i.redd.it/p6hmb1bak9z51.png
20/11/2020, 16:47 - +44 7752 359588: It's the most common harry potter pairings on the big fanfiction website
20/11/2020, 16:47 - +44 7752 359588: I think the most popular is interestingly Harry/Draco
20/11/2020, 16:51 - Reuben Yarwood: I would have maybe guessed that one
20/11/2020, 16:52 - +44 7752 359588: I mean it's always been common, but I feel like hermione/Draco was bigger when I was a weeee whippersnapper
20/11/2020, 16:52 - +44 7752 359588: But the amount of harry/snape... Some things do not change hahaha
20/11/2020, 16:53 - Reuben Yarwood: Love this. I thought that was an Albus Dumbledore - George Weesley line in there for a second!
20/11/2020, 16:54 - Reuben Yarwood: It was just Grindlewald
20/11/2020, 16:54 - +44 7752 359588: Somewhere on the internet that exists... I am sure
20/11/2020, 16:54 - +44 7752 359588: Everything exists
20/11/2020, 16:54 - Reuben Yarwood: I saw a Darth Vader/ Luke Skywalker one
20/11/2020, 16:54 - Reuben Yarwood: Pretty messed up
20/11/2020, 16:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh shit there's quite a lot of Harry/Voldemort stuff there
20/11/2020, 16:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Not far off
20/11/2020, 16:57 - +44 7752 359588: Oh duuuude
20/11/2020, 16:57 - +44 7752 359588: I mean there is not an insignificant amount of fred/george there
20/11/2020, 16:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice
20/11/2020, 17:20 - +44 7462 872590: Nearly Headless Nick/Moaning Myrtle
20/11/2020, 17:39 - +44 7752 359588: Oh that's definitely been written
20/11/2020, 17:41 - +44 7462 872590: By Peeves the Poltergeist
20/11/2020, 17:43 - James Kemp: Moaning Myrtle is such a wonderfully pornographic name
20/11/2020, 22:27 - +61 474 759 280: He added they had a lot of rehearsal time and they 'talked about it quite a bit, which is not something we often do on Supernatural.'
20/11/2020, 22:28 - +61 474 759 280: They‚Äôre really driving the macho angle in the pr release huh

21/11/2020, 09:38 - Aaron Ayling: "you" in quotation marks in case you end up with ego death and the realisation that we are all one conciousness experiencing itself subjectively

26/11/2020, 11:32 - James Kemp: Felt bad binning all those leftovers
26/11/2020, 11:32 - Aaron Ayling: So while this seems ratchet (the pay as you go, top-up system from like the 70s)on the surface I'm actually all for it because the reason we have to do it is there is one giant hot water tank for the whole apartment block.

So you never run out of hot water and never have to deal with a broken boiler again.
26/11/2020, 11:32 - James Kemp: Where do you top up?
26/11/2020, 11:32 - Aaron Ayling: Speaking of I left the rest of the ket in the top drawer of the coffee table, forgot to say!
26/11/2020, 11:33 - +44 7752 359588: I can do it online, so not too bad

30/11/2020, 15:19 - Aaron Ayling: McDonald's
30/11/2020, 15:19 - James Kemp: which have either a complex range or operate in a complex industry and make it accessible/easy to undersatnd for consumers
30/11/2020, 15:19 - James Kemp: so far i have one mediocre example - honestbrew and their 'intro to craft beer' boxes, guides to craft beer, etc.
30/11/2020, 15:19 - Aaron Ayling: I mean you could argue Apple
30/11/2020, 15:19 - Reuben Yarwood: I just started a savings account with Moneybox. Pretty user friendly. As is Monzo
30/11/2020, 15:20 - Aaron Ayling: They lock down their software for dumb dumbs
30/11/2020, 15:20 - Reuben Yarwood: Finance/saving being a bit complicated
30/11/2020, 15:20 - James Kemp: everyone always does
30/11/2020, 15:20 - James Kemp: this is more about range
30/11/2020, 15:20 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah it's boring
30/11/2020, 15:20 - James Kemp: a complicated range of products
30/11/2020, 15:20 - James Kemp: or a range of products with complicated credentials
30/11/2020, 15:20 - James Kemp: like loads of styles of craft beer
30/11/2020, 15:21 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm sure there's a coffee equivalent
30/11/2020, 15:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Or wine
30/11/2020, 15:21 - Aaron Ayling: Maybe squarespace?
30/11/2020, 15:22 - +44 7752 359588: Deciem/The Ordinary for skincare
30/11/2020, 15:22 - Aaron Ayling: Liz - The Ordinary?
30/11/2020, 15:22 - Aaron Ayling: Haha nice
30/11/2020, 15:22 - +44 7752 359588: They sell all the various serums straight up and do a ton of guidance on their website on how to build a routine
30/11/2020, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
30/11/2020, 15:23 - James Kemp: you two are _perfect_ for each other
30/11/2020, 15:23 - James Kemp: let there be no doubt of this fact ever
30/11/2020, 15:23 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah I've admired your bottles of that stuff for how simple it seems
30/11/2020, 15:23 - James Kemp: ooh yes that seems great
30/11/2020, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Aaron just listens to me wax on about skincare

30/11/2020, 15:25 - +44 7752 359588: I do think square space is also a good example
30/11/2020, 15:25 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like there must be this for coffee, but really drawing a blank
30/11/2020, 15:25 - James Kemp: yep, gonna check out square space
30/11/2020, 15:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Could maybe argue GoPro as well. They took one element of the video market - cameras for sports - and made it really good /intuitive
30/11/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: do they have an extensive range??
30/11/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: or is it just 1 thinig
30/11/2020, 15:26 - James Kemp: (that got me tripping)
30/11/2020, 15:26 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe juts the one range? HERO

30/11/2020, 15:27 - James Kemp: yeah i want a PHAT RANGE
30/11/2020, 15:27 - James Kemp: phat range made simple
30/11/2020, 15:27 - James Kemp: i am demanding in my asks i am sorry
30/11/2020, 15:27 - Reuben Yarwood: They created a range of cameras and integrated with colour grading software
30/11/2020, 15:27 - +44 7752 359588: Casper mattresses maybe? Don't know that the range is big, but mattresses are a daunting purchase for most people and I feel like they definitely target first time buyers
30/11/2020, 15:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Gave the software out for free and made it industry standard
30/11/2020, 15:28 - James Kemp: yas and YAS
30/11/2020, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: Fenty beauty supposedly does a really good skin shade matching quiz online and then will give you the whole range of products that work with your skin
30/11/2020, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: Don't know if that works
30/11/2020, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: But their range of skin tones for make up is MASSIVE
30/11/2020, 15:33 - James Kemp: thank you, friends!

30/11/2020, 20:11 - Aaron Ayling: There's a new Among Us map out btw
30/11/2020, 20:15 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh I bet they'll have Christmas stuff at some point
30/11/2020, 21:12 - +61 474 759 280: To close the loop on this I got laid heaps and had to turn down a day of hungover sex in bed for my weekly shift at the foodbank. In an Uber now with the hangover of a decade
30/11/2020, 21:13 - +44 7752 359588: Womp womo
30/11/2020, 21:13 - +44 7752 359588: But youre racking up that good karma at least
30/11/2020, 21:13 - +44 7752 359588: How litty were you?
30/11/2020, 21:13 - +61 474 759 280: https://youtu.be/bfddVDBq-L8
30/11/2020, 21:14 - +44 7752 359588: Alarmingly accurate
30/11/2020, 21:26 - +61 474 759 280: I was lit as folk
01/12/2020, 12:01 - Aaron Ayling: Anyone down for some Saturday games? 11am?
01/12/2020, 12:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah man

01/12/2020, 12:32 - Aaron Ayling: Should be! Especially if John and/or Sam are in!
01/12/2020, 12:32 - James Kemp: dani will get down with UW, too
01/12/2020, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: Ah nice!
01/12/2020, 12:33 - +44 7752 359588: After dani's last game, I assume the odds will now be that he is a werewolf in every single game
01/12/2020, 12:53 - James Kemp: ahaha

01/12/2020, 15:42 - +44 7752 359588: Bit kooky, festive, mystical
01/12/2020, 15:52 - Reuben Yarwood: There's more than one?

01/12/2020, 16:33 - +44 7752 359588: I am still disappointed he gave up on the idea of an album for each state
01/12/2020, 16:33 - James Kemp: yeah that'd be sickening
01/12/2020, 16:34 - James Kemp: florida is just 45:00 of "booooooooooooooooooo"
01/12/2020, 16:34 - James Kemp: with the final second "t"

07/12/2020, 12:11 - James Kemp: Oh yeah never phone
07/12/2020, 12:11 - Reuben Yarwood: "I'm not a warewolf, seriously!"
07/12/2020, 12:11 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>

07/12/2020, 14:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Kind of a trial run I guess, hopefully if it goes well I'll get a permanent gig next year
07/12/2020, 14:59 - Aaron Ayling: Ooh good luck! What sort of stuff do they do?

07/12/2020, 22:30 - Reuben Yarwood: This podcast is well with a listen. My man Yuval Noah Harari explaining why people buy into conspiracy theories so perfectly
07/12/2020, 22:30 - Reuben Yarwood: *well worth
08/12/2020, 12:31 - Aaron Ayling: Jim - off the top of your head - who sings the first line of 2 become 1?

08/12/2020, 12:31 - Aaron Ayling: (or anyone but lbr about who's gonna know that)
08/12/2020, 12:32 - James Kemp: not entirely sure, but that'd be my shot
08/12/2020, 12:32 - Aaron Ayling: It's Mel C!
08/12/2020, 12:32 - James Kemp: i was wrong!
08/12/2020, 12:32 - James Kemp: it's mel c!
08/12/2020, 12:32 - Aaron Ayling: Basically unsure what the show was
08/12/2020, 12:32 - Aaron Ayling: but on Gogglebox last night they were watching a quiz where Mel B was trying to answer that
08/12/2020, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: And she was seriously doubting herself between Mel C and Emma
08/12/2020, 12:33 - James Kemp: ahaha
08/12/2020, 12:33 - James Kemp: well if mel b is unsure
08/12/2020, 12:33 - James Kemp: i will sleep more easily tonight
08/12/2020, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: She got it right but was very worried
08/12/2020, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: She went HAM "deffo Mel C 100%"
08/12/2020, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: then was all "oh god now I don't know"
08/12/2020, 12:34 - James Kemp: i feel like mel c is a dud in the video
08/12/2020, 12:34 - James Kemp: and so just doesn't stick in my mind at all
08/12/2020, 12:34 - James Kemp: whereas i very clearly remember emma
08/12/2020, 12:34 - Aaron Ayling: i woud have gone Emma - it's a high voice
08/12/2020, 12:34 - James Kemp: the second i played it, i knew
08/12/2020, 12:34 - James Kemp: but from memory, dedting
08/12/2020, 12:36 - James Kemp: my second choice would've actually been mel b so i'm a really bad gay
08/12/2020, 12:36 - James Kemp: i associate mel c with the middle 8
08/12/2020, 12:36 - James Kemp: she always gets that bit, in my mind
09/12/2020, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
09/12/2020, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: Say hello to Helga Saxonburgh bitches
09/12/2020, 12:12 - +44 7752 359588: (PS Saxonburgh is deffo not a German name)
09/12/2020, 12:31 - Reuben Yarwood: A very thorough email from Mark (Sherlock)
09/12/2020, 12:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Are you going to be dressing as Helga?
09/12/2020, 12:37 - +44 7752 359588: I don't have a costume and am probably not committed enough to scrounging one up sadly
09/12/2020, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: We did give away the costume box when we moved
09/12/2020, 12:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh no!
09/12/2020, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: But also I don't think anything in that box read as "19th century ambassador's wife"
09/12/2020, 12:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Who had the pleasure of inheriting it?
09/12/2020, 12:39 - +44 7752 359588: Some lady from Gumtree
09/12/2020, 12:39 - +44 7752 359588: She was very eager
09/12/2020, 12:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice, so you just put it up as "free box of fancy dress shit"
09/12/2020, 12:40 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah I guess the Dolly Parton costume wouldn't really work with this one
09/12/2020, 12:42 - +44 7752 359588: Basically yea
09/12/2020, 12:43 - +44 7752 359588: Didn't even take pictures of what was in it, just gave it a vague description
09/12/2020, 12:43 - +44 7752 359588: It got a lot of interest
09/12/2020, 12:43 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think that work would enjoy my interpretation of her being an ambassador's wife, but also maybe a woman of the night
09/12/2020, 12:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Bit too much back story
09/12/2020, 21:04 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
09/12/2020, 21:07 - Reuben Yarwood: So colourful!
09/12/2020, 21:10 - +44 7752 359588: It's pretty much cheap poundland ornaments Aaron and Jim had from Richmond road

14/12/2020, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: Very specific
14/12/2020, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: It also depends on the type of beer though
14/12/2020, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: And the weather
14/12/2020, 11:32 - +44 7752 359588: Like a wintery day, 375 ml, give me a 8-9% porter

17/12/2020, 09:34 - James Kemp: i'd probably just go for the goodest of kush?

17/12/2020, 11:19 - Aaron Ayling: "millions doesn't really sound big enough anymore - how can we make it sound bigger without lying?"
17/12/2020, 11:23 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúMake it comic sans coz fuck em haha‚Äù
17/12/2020, 11:24 - +61 474 759 280: Would the black bars do anything legally or is that just for affect
17/12/2020, 11:25 - Aaron Ayling: just for effect
17/12/2020, 11:25 - Aaron Ayling: you can print pictures of celebrities fine
17/12/2020, 11:26 - Aaron Ayling: they're playing up on the "How DARE they demande privacy" angle they're trying to foster I think
17/12/2020, 11:40 - James Kemp: "this gullible firm"
17/12/2020, 11:41 - James Kemp: also "crap" was always more of a swear word than "damn" in my household
17/12/2020, 11:41 - James Kemp: just re: our previous conversation
17/12/2020, 11:41 - James Kemp: so i was TRIGGERED that that made the headline
17/12/2020, 11:44 - Aaron Ayling: yeah crap is worse than damn
17/12/2020, 11:44 - Aaron Ayling: like they're in the same league, but damn is in danger of relegation
17/12/2020, 11:45 - Aaron Ayling: and crap is hopeful of it's promotion prospects if the last few games go their way
17/12/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: janet once told me off for saying "sugar" in an exclamatory way
17/12/2020, 11:45 - James Kemp: because she considered that in the same leagues
17/12/2020, 12:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh I remember getting told off for saying crap
17/12/2020, 12:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Pretty sure I heard it in the Simpsons
17/12/2020, 12:03 - Reuben Yarwood: It's a gateway drug
17/12/2020, 12:04 - Aaron Ayling: "But that's where we live ... A _DAM_"
17/12/2020, 12:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Aaron you'll remember how swear word averse I was until a very late age
17/12/2020, 12:05 - Reuben Yarwood: You stole my pencil case once and refused to give it back unless I said "fuck a duck"
17/12/2020, 12:05 - Reuben Yarwood: I think we were about fifteen
17/12/2020, 12:06 - Aaron Ayling: haha i remembr that, but i will counter we were maybe 14
17/12/2020, 12:07 - James Kemp: i love that this makes a difference
17/12/2020, 12:08 - James Kemp: also reuben, so INNOCENT
17/12/2020, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: important facts
17/12/2020, 12:08 - James Kemp: i think i got told off for saying 'bitch' in year 5
17/12/2020, 12:08 - James Kemp: (age 9/10)
17/12/2020, 12:08 - James Kemp: i had a wild phase
17/12/2020, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: ooh that would have been way too much for me at that age
17/12/2020, 12:09 - James Kemp: tbf laura treadway was being a fucking bitch and she needed telling
17/12/2020, 12:09 - Reuben Yarwood: He still has that pencil case
17/12/2020, 12:09 - James Kemp: i quickly snapped back into shape in time for squaredom at secondary school
17/12/2020, 12:09 - Aaron Ayling: I told my brother that "lesbian" meant cool when I was 8 and when my mum told me off for it I told her that Jack Turvey at school told me it meant cool even though he didn't and I totally knew what it meant
17/12/2020, 12:10 - James Kemp: TROLL
17/12/2020, 12:10 - Reuben Yarwood: ^Littlefinger
17/12/2020, 12:10 - James Kemp: poor jack turvey
17/12/2020, 12:10 - Aaron Ayling: Oh my mum hated him
17/12/2020, 12:10 - Aaron Ayling: I knew what I was doing
17/12/2020, 12:11 - Aaron Ayling: which i guess just proves this even more
17/12/2020, 12:14 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
17/12/2020, 12:14 - James Kemp: guys guys do you like our coasters
17/12/2020, 12:14 - James Kemp: they were only ¬£6 from ikea

17/12/2020, 12:15 - Aaron Ayling: yeah v nice works with the pinapple
17/12/2020, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: They're very cute!
17/12/2020, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: Also, crap is borderline not a swear in the US!
17/12/2020, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: I did once name a computer folder Elizabeth's crap instead of junk and got a light telling off
17/12/2020, 12:19 - +44 7752 359588: But I could say crap in high school and it would have been chill
17/12/2020, 12:20 - Aaron Ayling: This is like when Matt Mysko had that (real) folder called "House Shit" and Sonia ripped off "shit" before we moved in
17/12/2020, 12:21 - James Kemp: ahaha
17/12/2020, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: Hahahaha oh man I forgot about that
17/12/2020, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, my mom also told me off a lot for saying the word sucks, so I think she was just doggered by certain words
17/12/2020, 12:25 - Reuben Yarwood: THESE SHOES SUCK
17/12/2020, 12:25 - Reuben Yarwood: "Liz!"
17/12/2020, 12:27 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha precisely
17/12/2020, 12:28 - Aaron Ayling: I think sucks was a bigger deal when it first came out as it's short for "sucks dick" right?
17/12/2020, 12:29 - Aaron Ayling: but now we're just used to it
17/12/2020, 12:29 - Aaron Ayling: like berk
17/12/2020, 12:31 - Reuben Yarwood: see you next tuesday you berkley hunt
17/12/2020, 12:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Or in the fish shop they would just say "oh it's this T-nuc again"
17/12/2020, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: Scunthorpe
17/12/2020, 12:46 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh is it??
17/12/2020, 12:59 - Aaron Ayling: yeah which is why i think your mum was triggered
17/12/2020, 12:59 - Aaron Ayling: just some casual homophobia
17/12/2020, 13:13 - Aaron Ayling: not on her part. the phrase "sucks" is/was that
17/12/2020, 13:53 - +61 474 759 280: Little finger
17/12/2020, 13:54 - +61 474 759 280: I wrote that before I scrolled down to Reuben‚Äôs call out
17/12/2020, 13:54 - +61 474 759 280: ‚úäüèΩ Reuben
17/12/2020, 13:59 - +61 474 759 280: As an addendum, my parents didn‚Äôt mind crap or damn, but I was the neglected third child so I could have sworn the house down without boo from them.. they had bigger fish to fry with my sister confessing to them every time she took weed/md/speed
17/12/2020, 14:00 - +61 474 759 280: She did this for reasons that are unclear to me to this day
17/12/2020, 14:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow, yeah why?
17/12/2020, 14:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Similarly my parents didn't give a shit about Madeleine swearing
17/12/2020, 14:02 - +61 474 759 280: Some sort of codependence needs idk lol
17/12/2020, 14:02 - +61 474 759 280: Made for a hell of a home life üòÇ
17/12/2020, 14:03 - +61 474 759 280: Made me the man I am today
17/12/2020, 14:11 - Aaron Ayling: I imagine this as as soon as she swallowed a pill/took a puff she was straight on the phone
17/12/2020, 14:11 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
17/12/2020, 14:20 - +44 7752 359588: I'd like to backtrack to the question of sucks and why that is suddenly gay
17/12/2020, 14:20 - +44 7752 359588: Sucking dick can be both gay and straight thank you very much
17/12/2020, 14:20 - +44 7752 359588: And everything in between
17/12/2020, 14:30 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
17/12/2020, 14:39 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah but I feel that the usage of "that sucks dick" which then comes to mean "is bad" has roots in homophobia?
17/12/2020, 14:39 - Aaron Ayling: Like straight people have bum sex too
17/12/2020, 14:39 - +44 7752 359588: Ah probably
17/12/2020, 14:40 - Aaron Ayling: But you call someone a bummer
17/12/2020, 14:40 - +44 7752 359588: But also it's probably a nice mixture of homophobia and misogyny
17/12/2020, 14:40 - Aaron Ayling: BY OUR POWERS COMBINED
17/12/2020, 14:41 - James Kemp: yeah i feel like its roots are in homophobia but it is definitely both
17/12/2020, 14:41 - James Kemp: US COCKSUCKERS NEED THE RESPECT WE DESERVE
17/12/2020, 14:49 - +44 7752 359588: Indeed
17/12/2020, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: Also I have never heard someone called a bummer before
17/12/2020, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: Just like things are bummers
17/12/2020, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: Oh man is that homophobic? Because I say that all the time
17/12/2020, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: But also we don't use the word bum in the us
17/12/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: yeah i think bummer the adjective and bummer the noun?
17/12/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: lmao
17/12/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: the adjective - not homophobic
17/12/2020, 15:01 - James Kemp: the noun - homophobic
17/12/2020, 15:02 - James Kemp: WHERE'S SUSIE DENT
17/12/2020, 15:02 - James Kemp: or bummer the ABSTRACT noun versus bummer the CONCRETE noun is probably more precise
17/12/2020, 15:03 - +44 7752 359588: Yes, like if something goes wrong, I would say "That's a bummer"
17/12/2020, 15:03 - +44 7752 359588: Thank you for this grammar lesson haha
17/12/2020, 15:03 - James Kemp: abstract, not homophobic
17/12/2020, 15:04 - James Kemp: versus "get out of my way, you bloody bummer"
17/12/2020, 15:04 - James Kemp: concrete, homophobic?
17/12/2020, 15:04 - +44 7752 359588: The more you know
17/12/2020, 15:04 - +44 7752 359588: Jim is this your last day of work for 2020?

17/12/2020, 15:06 - +44 7752 359588: Disgusting
17/12/2020, 15:06 - +44 7752 359588: I mean who schedules that for like 3 days before Christmas
17/12/2020, 15:08 - James Kemp: literally had a client ask us
17/12/2020, 15:08 - James Kemp: if we're working between christmas and new years
17/12/2020, 15:08 - James Kemp: NO WE'RE NOT BITCH
17/12/2020, 15:30 - +44 7752 359588: Good lord surely everything can wait
17/12/2020, 20:55 - +44 7752 359588: Watched the meet the queens

17/12/2020, 20:56 - +44 7752 359588: The one queen who described herself as the bendiest queen in east London is coming for you jim
17/12/2020, 21:29 - James Kemp: RIGHT
17/12/2020, 21:29 - James Kemp: But she was rough as fucking sin
17/12/2020, 21:29 - +44 7752 359588: I kind of lived for how rough she was
17/12/2020, 22:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Same, and great name
18/12/2020, 17:42 - +44 7752 359588: This bitch is on holiday for 2.5 weeks

18/12/2020, 18:06 - James Kemp: How was the Murder mystery?!
18/12/2020, 18:08 - +44 7752 359588: It was ridiculous
18/12/2020, 18:08 - +44 7752 359588: Really enjoyed it
18/12/2020, 18:08 - +44 7752 359588: Some of my colleagues got very into their characters and it was delightful
18/12/2020, 18:08 - +44 7752 359588: Also shadily, they made our ED a reformed lady of the night
18/12/2020, 18:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Haha. What were Becky and Sam?
18/12/2020, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: Becky doesn't work with us anymore! Hasn't for a few months
18/12/2020, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: Also she has covid currently
18/12/2020, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: But is doing ok
18/12/2020, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: Sam was an MP and defense minister
18/12/2020, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: AND ALSO THE MURDERER
18/12/2020, 18:25 - James Kemp: Oooooh

18/12/2020, 18:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Spicy!
18/12/2020, 18:30 - +44 7752 359588: No one knew!
18/12/2020, 18:30 - +44 7752 359588: Sam didn't even know he was the murderer haha
18/12/2020, 18:31 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah so far Becky is fine
18/12/2020, 18:31 - +44 7752 359588: Shes been doing her pgce and definitely got it from her school
18/12/2020, 18:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh yeah it must be an absolute nightmare teaching right now
18/12/2020, 18:31 - +44 7752 359588: Also guess we can assume that her vaccine trial was a placebo I guess
18/12/2020, 18:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Is she going to be a highschool English teacher then?
18/12/2020, 18:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh no way
18/12/2020, 18:32 - +44 7752 359588: Yep!
18/12/2020, 18:33 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh nice. She'll be a brilliant English teacher
18/12/2020, 18:33 - +44 7752 359588: She's really liking it so far! Think it suits her
18/12/2020, 18:33 - +44 7752 359588: Her placement is at an all boys catholic school tho
18/12/2020, 18:34 - +44 7752 359588: Which I think sounds like a nightmare, but she enjoys
18/12/2020, 18:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice.
18/12/2020, 18:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah definitely not for me.
18/12/2020, 18:36 - Reuben Yarwood: Would have totally fancied her if she was my teacher at King's though
18/12/2020, 21:36 - +61 474 759 280: https://twitter.com/thisistomlittle/status/1339928570949488640?s=24
18/12/2020, 21:47 - +44 7752 359588: Keira knightley was that young???
18/12/2020, 21:48 - +44 7752 359588: That makes it so gross
18/12/2020, 21:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Can you even get married at 17??
18/12/2020, 21:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Apparently 16-18 is possible but you need parental approval
18/12/2020, 21:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Unless you get married in Scotland
18/12/2020, 21:50 - Reuben Yarwood: I can only think of one reason you'd get married that young. Purity ring.
18/12/2020, 21:52 - +61 474 759 280: Yes!! In real life not the narrative of the film obvs

The Tom & Hanks pub, deep in rural Yuleshire. A reindeer is splayed out by the crackling hearth, chewing on a tennis ball. The deep, slack snare drum of Wham's 'Last Christmas' (and _only_ the snare) thuds gently on a loop from the quaint old-time radio set on the mantlepiece. "Pint of eggnog, barkeep!", I chime. "Certainly sir", comes the reply. And as the barman turns to face me, I gasp - 

...it's only bloody _Jesus_!

03/01/2021, 10:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Unlucky man, hope you're alright
03/01/2021, 10:29 - Sam Lea: Symptoms-wise atm, it could be worse - a lost (though partially returning?) sense of smell and sore throat. The worst thing right now is just it's got my anxiety right up, as you can imagine!
03/01/2021, 10:34 - Sam Lea: Just trying to find ways to not freak out about it
03/01/2021, 10:36 - Reuben Yarwood: If it's any reassurance Madeleine and Harold are in tip top shape
03/01/2021, 10:36 - Sam Lea: @447725504296 it would be quite helpful to hear about Madeleine's experience

03/01/2021, 10:44 - James Kemp: Yeah my brother (39) and sister (35) both got through it relatively unscathed!
03/01/2021, 10:45 - Sam Lea: What symptoms and things did they experience, Jim?
03/01/2021, 10:46 - James Kemp: My brother had a little bit of a worse time of it than my sister but nothing awful - think the worst he got was that he was in bed with a fever for a few days
03/01/2021, 10:46 - James Kemp: Neither needed a hospital or anything though
03/01/2021, 10:46 - Sam Lea: That's a relief

06/01/2021, 09:58 - Sam Lea: Does this mean the Dems can make everything alright now, if they're feeling so inclined?
06/01/2021, 10:00 - Aaron Ayling: Well in theory
06/01/2021, 10:00 - Aaron Ayling: But any legislation needs all the Dems to vote yes
06/01/2021, 10:00 - Aaron Ayling: And there's a lot of shit Dems in there
06/01/2021, 10:00 - Aaron Ayling: So basically they won't be feeling so inclined
06/01/2021, 10:00 - Aaron Ayling: BUT it's a fucking LOT better than the alternative!

06/01/2021, 10:32 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah the election was yesterday
06/01/2021, 10:33 - Aaron Ayling: Combination of that + the stimulus checks holuo + Stacey Abrams efforts over the last 2 years probably tipped it
06/01/2021, 10:33 - Aaron Ayling: Also reduced republican turnout as Trump wasn't on the ballot according to 538
06/01/2021, 10:34 - Aaron Ayling: Stacey Abrams being the most integral part of that formula, by all accounts
06/01/2021, 10:36 - +44 7462 872590: I also read the around 23,000 people in Georgia who weren't old enough to vote in the November election have come of age since then... Assuming they are overwhelming Dem voters.

07/01/2021, 21:42 - +44 7752 359588: Like you can only have like 8 apps at once
07/01/2021, 21:43 - +44 7752 359588: I'll charge her up tomorrow and see if she works
07/01/2021, 21:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Much obliged
07/01/2021, 22:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Her old phone could only have about 4 so that's twice as good!
08/01/2021, 13:44 - Aaron Ayling: that's some good snow
08/01/2021, 13:53 - Reuben Yarwood: Wehay. Hopefully it sticks
08/01/2021, 14:11 - James Kemp: the nature you got on your doorstep

08/01/2021, 14:20 - +44 7462 872590: I'm very lucky sitting it out here
08/01/2021, 14:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Speaking of lucky, have any of youse got bitcoin?
08/01/2021, 14:32 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha no
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Aaron Ayling: Nah don't fuck with that ish
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Slightly regretting not getting some last year when it was 1/4 the price
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Go on Aaron
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Reuben Yarwood: What's your reasoning apart from it being volatile af
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah but you never know - it's such a bubble
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Aaron Ayling: Also cba figuring it out
08/01/2021, 14:32 - Sam Lea: I bought 30 quids worth during the last massive spike in 2017, right before it immediately crashed
08/01/2021, 14:33 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah that's basically my outlook
08/01/2021, 14:33 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah that's my main reason haha
08/01/2021, 14:34 - Reuben Yarwood: Did you keep it?
08/01/2021, 14:34 - Sam Lea: Cashed out a cool 60 yesterday as it seems to be insanely over-hyped... Could regret that but hey ho.
08/01/2021, 14:34 - Reuben Yarwood: Hoo boy!
08/01/2021, 14:35 - Sam Lea: There seems to be a huge ad campaign for it on the tube right now?
08/01/2021, 14:39 - James Kemp: Big vibe
08/01/2021, 14:40 - James Kemp: Would currently rather stay poor than exert any kind of effort
08/01/2021, 14:40 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
08/01/2021, 15:33 - Edward Beesley: I bought about ¬£100's worth around June last year which is now worth about ¬£550... Enough of a gain to make me regret not having bought more, but not enough to make me want to risk buying more while it's spiking at the moment. Would buy more maybe if there's another big crash
08/01/2021, 15:34 - Edward Beesley: Either way, the Amsterdam drug dealers that I paid in bitcoin have made a tidy profit since i bought my truffles from them in December
08/01/2021, 15:35 - Sam Lea: dayummm
08/01/2021, 15:35 - Edward Beesley: I think there's basically no way to figure it out, so it's pure gamble
08/01/2021, 15:55 - James Kemp: i have been a sneaky mom
08/01/2021, 15:56 - James Kemp: my boss mentioned an amazing job coach who helped her husband figure his shit out and decide on a new career path

08/01/2021, 15:57 - James Kemp: she replied: "Hi Jim! I‚Äôd absolutely love to arrange a conversation with a person with your photo!! Brilliant!!!"
08/01/2021, 15:57 - James Kemp: is that weird?
08/01/2021, 15:57 - James Kemp: i think that's weird
08/01/2021, 15:58 - Reuben Yarwood: With a person with your photo??
08/01/2021, 15:58 - Aaron Ayling: ... what's your photo?
08/01/2021, 15:58 - Reuben Yarwood: As in you look really good in the photo?
08/01/2021, 15:58 - Aaron Ayling: yeah it's confusingly worded eh, but I think she means this
08/01/2021, 15:59 - James Kemp: i think it's suburban mom for 'you look fun'?
08/01/2021, 15:59 - James Kemp: (she looks like a suburban mom)
08/01/2021, 15:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Coming on a bit strong
08/01/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: also checking out potential companies to fire to CVs - potentially interested in one, then read down
08/01/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: "Resurgo is a Christian organisation working with all irrespective of faith to achieve our shared social vision more effectively together."
08/01/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: BOOT

08/01/2021, 16:16 - +44 7752 359588: Also this is super weird, but I like the energy
08/01/2021, 16:17 - Aaron Ayling: I dislike the wording "with a person with a photo"
08/01/2021, 16:18 - Aaron Ayling: "Very happy to have a meeting with anyone with as fun a photo as that" would be better
08/01/2021, 16:18 - James Kemp: i just feel like discussing photos is a slippery slope to a vice article
08/01/2021, 16:48 - Reuben Yarwood: You are fit therefore let's meet

11/01/2021, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Ends paragraph with: "I hope this sheds some light on my university and that I shouldbe taken seriously as a candidate."
11/01/2021, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: I mean also talks about their teaching awards, but A: I don't need convincing that Huddersfield is perfectly respectable, and B: maybe don't lead with having a pedo as your chancellor?
11/01/2021, 12:23 - Aaron Ayling: Also even ignoring the Prince Andrew namedrop, its a bad argument. Show how its great for what you want to study and that rankings are bollocks etc.
11/01/2021, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: Also Patrick Stewary needs to disassociate with that mess

11/01/2021, 12:28 - Reuben Yarwood: Should definitely know better surely?

13/01/2021, 15:15 - Aaron Ayling: All the trimmings
13/01/2021, 15:15 - Aaron Ayling: The one at school was a hole in the ground so would generally try to go at home
13/01/2021, 15:18 - James Kemp: they were the worst for hungover throwing up in
13/01/2021, 15:18 - James Kemp: the squat toilets
13/01/2021, 15:18 - James Kemp: nothing to clutch
13/01/2021, 15:20 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 17:05 - +44 7752 359588: Nightmare
13/01/2021, 17:06 - +44 7752 359588: Would like to belatedly chime in and ponder if loo roll companies are concerned about bidets coming for them
13/01/2021, 19:26 - +44 7752 359588: Important news: ESC is fully committed having eurovision in one form or the other this year
13/01/2021, 19:26 - +44 7752 359588: Tis the season!
13/01/2021, 19:26 - James Kemp: Omfg
13/01/2021, 19:27 - +44 7752 359588: Worst case scenario they air pre-recorded, but unedited performances from each country
13/01/2021, 19:27 - +44 7752 359588: Honestly I'll take anything at this point
13/01/2021, 19:27 - James Kemp: Yeah fucking need it
13/01/2021, 19:27 - James Kemp: What‚Äôs the latest with Americavision?

13/01/2021, 19:46 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 19:47 - +44 7752 359588: Haunting
13/01/2021, 19:47 - James Kemp: There‚Äôs tonight‚Äôs wank material sorted
13/01/2021, 21:53 - Sam Lea: Well, there we have it lads
13/01/2021, 21:53 - Sam Lea: Imüçëment
13/01/2021, 21:55 - James Kemp: Based on that voting ratio he won‚Äôt get found guilty tho, eh?
13/01/2021, 21:55 - James Kemp: Like wot does impeachment mean/do if not subsequently found guilty?
13/01/2021, 21:56 - +61 474 759 280: https://twitter.com/theonion/status/1346939860377096193?s=24
14/01/2021, 08:14 - Aaron Ayling: Well impeachment is the "guilty" verdict I think. Its part of a larger mechanism which on its own doesn't mean that much - basically a "Please can the Senate deal with this" signifier. Does change the history books though - Trump has 50% of all impeachment now, and the most bipartisan impeachment ever (10 republicans voted for impeachment)
14/01/2021, 08:15 - Aaron Ayling: The senate then decides what to do with said impeachment, which in the past has mostly been "nothing lol". Needs 2/3 of senators to remove him (or if he's already gone it will stop him getting the pension and from ever holding public office again)
14/01/2021, 08:16 - Aaron Ayling: So yeah 16 republicans need to grow a backbone which is unlikely, however there's a chance they may want to ensure he doesn't come back in 2024 and split the party.
14/01/2021, 08:16 - Aaron Ayling: (Liz weigh in if I'm wrong plz)
14/01/2021, 08:35 - +44 7752 359588: Yep that all tracks
14/01/2021, 08:35 - +44 7752 359588: The senate will have to have a hearing
14/01/2021, 08:35 - +44 7752 359588: And then a vote
14/01/2021, 08:36 - +44 7752 359588: I am not optimistic they'll convict
14/01/2021, 09:15 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs just weird they refer to him as being impeached when that basically means jack shit without the second part
14/01/2021, 09:39 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah I‚Äôd forgotten he‚Äôd already been impeached
14/01/2021, 09:40 - James Kemp: watched an interview with comey yday
14/01/2021, 09:40 - James Kemp: where he was like: i know it's fucking weird for me as fbi man to say this, but i think we shouldn't be putting him on trial post-presidency. let him rot in the shadows, don't give him the oxygen of a 4 year trial.
14/01/2021, 09:41 - James Kemp: which depressed me a bit, as i'm baying for blood
14/01/2021, 10:07 - Aaron Ayling: I'm hoping Giuliani turns on him and sues him after trump refuses to pay his legal fees
14/01/2021, 10:08 - Aaron Ayling: That'll give me what I'm after
14/01/2021, 10:19 - +61 474 759 280: I love that Giuliani and Dershowitz are his impeachment defence
14/01/2021, 10:19 - +61 474 759 280: #dreamteam

14/01/2021, 10:29 - Aaron Ayling: Calling for trial by combat was pretty iconic
14/01/2021, 10:47 - James Kemp: okay here is a shocking stat for you
14/01/2021, 10:47 - James Kemp: hold onto your toupees
14/01/2021, 10:47 - James Kemp: it takes 137 litres of water to produce a SINGLE toilet roll
14/01/2021, 10:53 - Aaron Ayling: Coz of like the trees needed?
14/01/2021, 10:54 - James Kemp: more in the production processes after
14/01/2021, 10:54 - James Kemp: making it all cushion-y
14/01/2021, 10:54 - James Kemp: but yes in the trees too!
14/01/2021, 11:07 - +44 7752 359588: That is wild
14/01/2021, 11:07 - +44 7752 359588: So we should all be getting bidets then
14/01/2021, 11:09 - James Kemp: probably, yes
14/01/2021, 11:09 - James Kemp: but nobody's studied the manufacture of bidets yet
14/01/2021, 11:09 - James Kemp: LOL what is my life

14/01/2021, 11:11 - James Kemp: i am sorry for what i am doing to you all
14/01/2021, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Americans on average use 36.5 billion rolls of toilet paper each year.
14/01/2021, 11:18 - Reuben Yarwood: This was the fact that got me^
14/01/2021, 11:18 - James Kemp: each american?!
14/01/2021, 11:18 - James Kemp: (imagine)
14/01/2021, 11:18 - James Kemp: using a 9 pack for each shit
14/01/2021, 11:19 - James Kemp: not even unwrapping it, just using the whole block
14/01/2021, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: I did have a toilet paper fight with a one night stand once
14/01/2021, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Used a whole industrial sized roll she had nicked from the club
14/01/2021, 11:20 - James Kemp: you did?

14/01/2021, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: I don't understand this question
14/01/2021, 11:21 - James Kemp: how did she end up using a whole industrial sized loo roll?
14/01/2021, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: She stole it
14/01/2021, 11:21 - James Kemp: like was she just shitting non top
14/01/2021, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: And brought it home to save money on paper
14/01/2021, 11:22 - James Kemp: i thought you meant she used it up in one sitting
14/01/2021, 11:22 - James Kemp: *one shitting
14/01/2021, 11:23 - Aaron Ayling: Knew guys that did this at uni - stole tp from school
14/01/2021, 11:24 - Aaron Ayling: "if they're going to limit how much I can print with how much I'm paying em I'm getting my money's worth elsewhere" was the logic
14/01/2021, 11:25 - James Kemp: i'd steal it from work sometimes tbh
14/01/2021, 11:25 - James Kemp: if i'd run out and cba going to tesco on the way home
14/01/2021, 11:25 - James Kemp: and i was indulging in this behaviour as recently as last year
14/01/2021, 11:25 - James Kemp: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

14/01/2021, 11:27 - Aaron Ayling: Get your perks where you can
14/01/2021, 11:27 - Aaron Ayling: Like if you just held it in til work everyday noone would bat an eye
14/01/2021, 11:28 - Reuben Yarwood: I used to take a lot of fruit and tea and stuff from Lispync when I was a runner
14/01/2021, 11:28 - Reuben Yarwood: Most of it went in the bin at the end of the week anyway
14/01/2021, 11:28 - Reuben Yarwood: And they were paying me ¬£13.5k a year so fuck them
14/01/2021, 11:29 - +61 474 759 280: I chortled at this
14/01/2021, 11:29 - Aaron Ayling: That argument would legally hold up in court

14/01/2021, 14:22 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
14/01/2021, 14:24 - Reuben Yarwood: What are the chances that's real?
14/01/2021, 14:24 - James Kemp: well he's only commented to say he's not commenting
14/01/2021, 14:24 - James Kemp: i haven't gone deep enough into the story to know if it's any more than a kink
14/01/2021, 14:24 - James Kemp: presuming it is, respect
14/01/2021, 14:24 - James Kemp: if it ends up being abusive, obv messier
14/01/2021, 14:24 - Aaron Ayling: I'm guessing he sent them out of the blue/to people who didn't want them?
14/01/2021, 14:25 - James Kemp: no apparently to the same 1 person?
14/01/2021, 14:26 - James Kemp: also not clear that it was anything but consensual?
14/01/2021, 14:26 - James Kemp: so many clickbait-y stories about it, hard to get to the t
14/01/2021, 14:26 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah like those messages you posted seem fine if it's to someone consenting and you know he's not really gonna eat your toes
14/01/2021, 14:27 - Aaron Ayling: But like as a Tinder opener - big yikes
14/01/2021, 14:27 - James Kemp: i'd kind of respect it
14/01/2021, 14:28 - Aaron Ayling: Grindr opener - too vanilla of anything

14/01/2021, 14:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Don't want to kink shame the consenting cannibals eh!

14/01/2021, 14:30 - James Kemp: for a fuck with armie
14/01/2021, 14:30 - James Kemp: give me the right drugs
14/01/2021, 14:32 - +44 7752 359588: I mean you would just think he'd be smart enough to not be sending this shiz via social media
14/01/2021, 14:32 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha I respect this choice
14/01/2021, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: Also is this cannibalism or more sort of like extreme domming
14/01/2021, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: He just wants to keep the toe
14/01/2021, 14:33 - James Kemp: thing is, i don't think my little toe is my best toe
14/01/2021, 14:41 - Reuben Yarwood: I'd give him my toenail clippings, would that count?
14/01/2021, 14:41 - James Kemp: 100% not
14/01/2021, 14:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Wouldn't you just own this and play it off as a bit of fun?
14/01/2021, 14:43 - Reuben Yarwood: I think it's pretty jokes
14/01/2021, 14:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Assuming as Aaron said that it's with someone who is consenting

15/01/2021, 11:11 - Reuben Yarwood: Is it not a bit dodgy that this "The Worlds First Digital Supermodel" digital influencer:
15/01/2021, 11:11 - Reuben Yarwood: https://www.instagram.com/shudu.gram/
15/01/2021, 11:12 - +61 474 759 280: FIT
15/01/2021, 11:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Was created by this guy
15/01/2021, 11:13 - +61 474 759 280: But I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs happening
15/01/2021, 11:13 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
15/01/2021, 11:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Just creeps me out a bit that he's created a super chic black woman for his own profit
15/01/2021, 11:15 - Reuben Yarwood: And she's doing like sponsored ads with Samsung
15/01/2021, 11:16 - Aaron Ayling: It's like Blacksploitation taken to the modern conclusion
15/01/2021, 11:17 - Aaron Ayling: An interesting moral quandary though.
15/01/2021, 11:18 - Aaron Ayling: Parallels with Hatsune Miku
15/01/2021, 11:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh yeah the virtual popstar?
15/01/2021, 11:19 - Aaron Ayling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku
15/01/2021, 11:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah also v creepy!
15/01/2021, 11:19 - Aaron Ayling: Miku's personification has been marketed as a virtual idol and has performed at concerts onstage as an animated projection (rear cast projection on a specially coated glass screen).[2]
15/01/2021, 11:19 - Aaron Ayling: Like is this not also like Gorillaz?
15/01/2021, 11:20 - Aaron Ayling: I deffo feel icky about it but am trying to figure out why
15/01/2021, 11:20 - Reuben Yarwood: I finally watched Perfect Blue while not high the other day and it's a great look at how the idol culture is messed up
15/01/2021, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Really worth a sober watch
15/01/2021, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: But yeah with the Instagram thing he says he's trying to create more black representation in the media
15/01/2021, 11:21 - Reuben Yarwood: But wouldn't it be better if he just paid real models?
15/01/2021, 11:29 - +61 474 759 280: But look Reuben how could he compete?
15/01/2021, 11:38 - Reuben Yarwood: You make a fair point
15/01/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: i thought this was the model at first
15/01/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: and was like - surely you'd design someone fitter?
15/01/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: feels very ex machina
15/01/2021, 11:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Loool
15/01/2021, 11:51 - Aaron Ayling: I feel like in the seventh season about us when we're really reaching for plot lines this guy would turn up as George's Eastern European couson
15/01/2021, 11:52 - James Kemp: when none of us are played by our original actors
15/01/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: and there's a time travelling version of reuben randomly drugging girls across the millennia
15/01/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: (wuvoo roobz)
15/01/2021, 11:54 - Reuben Yarwood: What do I have to do to distance myself from this slanderous characterisation
15/01/2021, 11:55 - Reuben Yarwood: Is this when we jump the shark?
15/01/2021, 11:55 - Reuben Yarwood: How do you say Football Fan in Latvian
15/01/2021, 12:03 - +44 7752 359588: John's character replaced by a previously never mentioned cousin from America
15/01/2021, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: I would like my replacement actress to be the ilana from broad city
15/01/2021, 12:05 - +44 7752 359588: Although I think she'd be too spenny for a season 7 replacement
15/01/2021, 12:05 - James Kemp: the ilana from the broadest of cities
15/01/2021, 12:48 - Reuben Yarwood: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55658942
15/01/2021, 12:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Another one for you George
15/01/2021, 12:52 - James Kemp: Lmao what a tool
15/01/2021, 12:53 - James Kemp: Trying to convince the council on the vague promise they could get millions
15/01/2021, 12:53 - James Kemp: And who foots the bill if they don‚Äôt, cunt?
15/01/2021, 12:53 - Reuben Yarwood: He offered them 10% then upped it to 25
15/01/2021, 12:54 - Reuben Yarwood: I mean there's no way he's finding it, wouldn't you just offer them 99%
15/01/2021, 12:54 - Reuben Yarwood: You'd still be loaded and they might bite
15/01/2021, 12:54 - James Kemp: They would never bite
15/01/2021, 12:55 - James Kemp: It‚Äôd cost them millions, that article says!
15/01/2021, 12:55 - James Kemp: All for a potential so small

15/01/2021, 13:46 - Aaron Ayling: Happy to keep it as 11 out of habit in spite of the lack of John if that works?

22/01/2021, 19:36 - +44 7752 359588: She is very pretty!
22/01/2021, 19:36 - James Kemp: I had the eliminee down as a predicted top 3
22/01/2021, 19:36 - +44 7752 359588: But I will also contend that everyone else in that group is kind of boogs
22/01/2021, 19:36 - James Kemp: And really liked her
22/01/2021, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh really
22/01/2021, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: Intriguing
22/01/2021, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: Didn't really rate her
22/01/2021, 19:37 - James Kemp: I just thought she seemed really calm and confident in a way that made me buy into her
22/01/2021, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: Fair!
22/01/2021, 19:37 - James Kemp: She didn‚Äôt seem desperate like some of them?
22/01/2021, 19:38 - Aaron Ayling: If anyone is bored tonight btw I'm trying out twitch streaming for the first time with a Zelda randomiser - https://www.twitch.tv/aayl1
22/01/2021, 19:38 - +44 7752 359588: I didn't think she stood out much to me
22/01/2021, 19:38 - James Kemp: Ah I loved her gay icon look week 1!
22/01/2021, 19:38 - James Kemp: It was my fave, I think??
22/01/2021, 19:39 - James Kemp: I also just thought she seemed really chill with her entrance mishap
22/01/2021, 19:39 - James Kemp: Endeared me to her from the bay
22/01/2021, 19:39 - James Kemp: Bat

22/01/2021, 19:42 - +44 7752 359588: Probably the only other non boog to be fair
22/01/2021, 19:43 - +44 7752 359588: Like I think veronica is such a cutie, but she isn't necessarily pretty
22/01/2021, 19:43 - +44 7752 359588: (in boy drag I mean)
22/01/2021, 19:43 - James Kemp: Ginny‚Äôs look this week made me LOL

22/01/2021, 19:43 - James Kemp: No her runway
22/01/2021, 19:44 - +44 7752 359588: It was a Liz in high school aspirational look
22/01/2021, 19:44 - +44 7752 359588: Oh this was also a toot
22/01/2021, 19:44 - James Kemp: Oh I don‚Äôt remember her boy look?!
22/01/2021, 19:44 - James Kemp: I was clearly not paying enough attention!
22/01/2021, 19:44 - +44 7752 359588: But genuinely she was in a tie dye rainbow number and there were scarves and she looked like a dirty hippie
22/01/2021, 19:44 - +44 7752 359588: I loved ir

24/01/2021, 21:01 - +61 474 759 280: Learning that emergency management has two gears only, unspeakable horror and tedium. This week has been the latter option

27/01/2021, 08:24 - Aaron Ayling: How was that? Looks too manky for me

27/01/2021, 12:01 - Aaron Ayling: 500
27/01/2021, 12:02 - James Kemp: 501
27/01/2021, 12:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Actually not that bad, but still surprised me

27/01/2021, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: I mean that's like 35 mins a day
27/01/2021, 13:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah that's pretty reasonable
27/01/2021, 13:08 - Reuben Yarwood: Doesn't include youtube/TV though
27/01/2021, 18:02 - James Kemp: So we‚Äôre at the point
27/01/2021, 18:02 - James Kemp: Where I‚Äôm going to fake being in hospital to get some time off work
27/01/2021, 18:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Are you planning on getting the 'rona?
27/01/2021, 18:08 - James Kemp: Gonna maybe fake a stress related faint
27/01/2021, 18:08 - James Kemp: Get Dani to text
27/01/2021, 18:08 - James Kemp: And then just go off grid
27/01/2021, 18:08 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm fucking *done*
27/01/2021, 18:11 - James Kemp: nobody's listening to us all complaining so
27/01/2021, 18:14 - Reuben Yarwood: God damn. Sounds rough man
27/01/2021, 18:17 - Aaron Ayling: Oh that sounds fucking rough
27/01/2021, 18:17 - Aaron Ayling: I am behind you 200%
27/01/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: nobody has listened
27/01/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: if i say anything, the solves will be minimal
27/01/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: i'll be fucking a few people over, but reap what you sow
27/01/2021, 20:15 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah so hopefully they'll realise how shit they've been eh if you're off with stress
27/01/2021, 20:16 - +44 7752 359588: That really sucks - godspeed with it
27/01/2021, 20:16 - +44 7752 359588: Someone else had a stress related leave didn't they? So hopefully that works fine
27/01/2021, 20:41 - Reuben Yarwood: It was multiple people wasn't it? Obviously stretching everybody to breaking point....
28/01/2021, 02:22 - +61 474 759 280: Alert to hear it‚Äôs got to that Jim :/
28/01/2021, 02:22 - +61 474 759 280: Sorry*
28/01/2021, 02:22 - +61 474 759 280: But I am alert to it as well
28/01/2021, 02:23 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôve just moved into the skaglands of Melbourne
28/01/2021, 02:23 - +61 474 759 280: The hottest of hot spots, where the local debate is whether they should shut down the safe injecting room or open a 2nd one
28/01/2021, 08:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Yes! You enjoying the new digs? New flatmate?
28/01/2021, 10:04 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah love it. Haven‚Äôt had any face time with the new housemate yet, beers tomorrow night
28/01/2021, 10:05 - Aaron Ayling: Ooh great to hear the move went well
28/01/2021, 10:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Most importantly, is the Gack Station installed?
28/01/2021, 10:10 - +44 7752 359588: Exciting!!!
28/01/2021, 10:22 - James Kemp: new flat pics plz?!
28/01/2021, 10:22 - James Kemp: also i opted for the (slightly less dramatic) work solve
28/01/2021, 10:22 - James Kemp: and quit
28/01/2021, 10:23 - James Kemp: bring on pandemic unemployment!!!
28/01/2021, 10:26 - Aaron Ayling: Sounds like that's the right call Jim - hope you're feeling better now you've made the call!
28/01/2021, 10:26 - Aaron Ayling: And I also hope you read them to FILTH in the exit interview
28/01/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: well i am officially 'taking the weekend to think about it'
28/01/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: but
28/01/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: i have quit in my mind
28/01/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: (and will do so formally on monday)
28/01/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: just want the self-reassurance that this feeling is more than a whim
28/01/2021, 10:33 - Aaron Ayling: Hope they are shitting themselves at the thought of losing you
28/01/2021, 10:33 - James Kemp: i mean, who the fuck wants to be unemployed right now?
28/01/2021, 10:33 - James Kemp: that's how bad it has gotten
28/01/2021, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: Oh damn - godspeed. Sounds like the right call though!
28/01/2021, 11:24 - +61 474 759 280: Really sorry to hear that Jim. As a silver lining, you‚Äôre probably getting the best bang for your buck being unemployed now because there‚Äôs no social pressure to go out and spend money
28/01/2021, 11:24 - Reuben Yarwood: Woooooow, good effort
28/01/2021, 11:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Definitely sounds like the right call. Do you think they'll be offering you compromises on Monday?
28/01/2021, 11:26 - Reuben Yarwood: It's a brave move, good on you for putting your mental health first
28/01/2021, 11:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Also you're talented and experienced as fuck so I'm sure once you're feeling up to it there will be work out there for you
28/01/2021, 11:28 - James Kemp: thanks, guys
28/01/2021, 11:28 - James Kemp: they asked me if there's anything they can do
28/01/2021, 11:28 - James Kemp: and i said honestly i think it's beyond that point
28/01/2021, 11:29 - James Kemp: any 'fixes' would be a short-term plaster - the problem will crop up again in 1/2 weeks/months
28/01/2021, 11:29 - +44 7462 872590: Sorry to hear that Jim, but sounds like the right call.
28/01/2021, 11:29 - James Kemp: so yes - hopefully this doesn't mean blowing through all my fucking savings, but gotta do what's right for meeee
28/01/2021, 11:29 - James Kemp: if it does i'll start an onlyfans and you can all pay me
28/01/2021, 11:30 - +44 7462 872590: Sesh pad 2.0 üçª

28/01/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: I met her, she‚Äôs nice and down to earth. Was slating the anti-vaxers in her congregation
28/01/2021, 12:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Are they allowed funny business?
28/01/2021, 12:48 - +44 7752 359588: That's hot
28/01/2021, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: When I lived with that c of e curate, he was definitely sleeping with his girlfriend
28/01/2021, 12:58 - +61 474 759 280: I think they are
28/01/2021, 20:43 - James Kemp: Things that wouldn‚Äôt fly in 2020

28/01/2021, 20:57 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh intriguing
28/01/2021, 20:57 - +44 7752 359588: Probably wouldn't be an aesthetic these days
28/01/2021, 20:57 - James Kemp: I feel like the vertical writing signals she‚Äôs meant to be Japanese in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel okay?
28/01/2021, 21:01 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh didn't clock that
28/01/2021, 21:01 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah it reads like a geisha vibe a bit

29/01/2021, 11:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Feels like a good cause
29/01/2021, 11:57 - Sam Lea: Caught a bit of AOC talking about it on Twitch almost as a radical act of class defiance and I've gotta say, the hype is pretty irresistable
29/01/2021, 11:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah definitely. But I'm not going to put in more than I'd be willing to lose
29/01/2021, 11:58 - +61 474 759 280: Act of class buy-in* surely? üòÖ
29/01/2021, 11:59 - Sam Lea: airhorn.jpg
29/01/2021, 12:10 - +44 7462 872590: Can't do Sunday I'm afraid. But can catch up next weekend.

29/01/2021, 15:04 - Aaron Ayling: I've repented and think I want Chinese for dinner now

29/01/2021, 15:05 - Aaron Ayling: Believe on Jesus Christ
29/01/2021, 15:06 - Reuben Yarwood: We are all sinners

29/01/2021, 15:07 - Aaron Ayling: Whoremongers and sorcerers
29/01/2021, 15:07 - +44 7752 359588: Murderers and whoremongers and sorcerer's and idolators
29/01/2021, 15:07 - James Kemp: Ahahaha
29/01/2021, 15:07 - James Kemp: Couple come THROUGH
29/01/2021, 15:08 - +44 7752 359588: But done to the tune of chauvinists and sexists and misogynists
29/01/2021, 15:08 - +44 7752 359588: Loool
29/01/2021, 15:08 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I was looking at the longer version Liz but liked the pared back one
29/01/2021, 15:09 - Aaron Ayling: Wages of Sin is a decent metal band
29/01/2021, 15:09 - James Kemp: Yeah there‚Äôs huge metal potential here
29/01/2021, 15:09 - +44 7752 359588: My back up is either thatbelieveth or second death
29/01/2021, 15:09 - +44 7752 359588: Thatbelieveth is clearly my christian pop group
29/01/2021, 15:09 - James Kemp: And emo pop potential: Hope Through the Blood
29/01/2021, 15:10 - James Kemp: Payment for Sin is pretty good

29/01/2021, 15:13 - Edward Beesley: "Rev 218" would do nicely
29/01/2021, 15:13 - James Kemp: I would gurn my tits off on the dance floor to ‚ÄúNow You Know (How To Get To Heaven)‚Äù
29/01/2021, 15:13 - James Kemp: üíØ

29/01/2021, 15:15 - James Kemp: The fake lead up of ‚ÄúWe All Deserve (To Go To Hell)‚Äù tiggles me
29/01/2021, 15:16 - James Kemp: This CAT
29/01/2021, 15:18 - Edward Beesley: This reminds me of when Sam and I were in a band and my mum would regularly cut out random phrases she'd seen in magazines that she thought would work as potential band names, and stick them to the microwave door
29/01/2021, 15:18 - James Kemp: Ahaha that‚Äôs so sweet!
29/01/2021, 15:18 - James Kemp: You need to find a pic of that microwave door
29/01/2021, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: That is adorable
29/01/2021, 15:35 - Edward Beesley: Unfortunately they were mostly terrible. Things like "Nicest of Knits"
29/01/2021, 15:35 - +44 7752 359588: I quite like that
29/01/2021, 15:35 - +44 7752 359588: Feels very grandma-core
29/01/2021, 16:02 - +44 7462 872590: I feel like "The Pinchable Cheeks" would work well.
29/01/2021, 16:03 - James Kemp: Saucy
29/01/2021, 19:21 - Aaron Ayling: Hi friends - playing some Zelda ocarina of Time on my twitch channel tonight - going live in a bit. Come say hi in the chat if you tune in!

Twitch.tv/aayl1
29/01/2021, 19:21 - James Kemp: I will be joining!!
30/01/2021, 09:38 - +44 7752 359588: My parents just had round one of the vaccine!
30/01/2021, 09:39 - +44 7752 359588: In a very bonkers way too - their neighbor works for a big hospital and was basically like, can you be here in 20 minutes, we have vaccines to use up
30/01/2021, 09:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh nice! Will they still get round two then?
30/01/2021, 09:42 - +44 7752 359588: Yep!
30/01/2021, 09:42 - +44 7752 359588: Everything is more chaotic in the us
30/01/2021, 09:44 - +44 7752 359588: There's obviously no national or even real state plan for distribution
30/01/2021, 09:45 - +44 7752 359588: But they are considered to be in the first round group for illinois and this was also the health system they would have ultimately gotten it from
30/01/2021, 09:52 - +44 7462 872590: Yay! That's good news about your folks Liz
30/01/2021, 09:54 - +44 7752 359588: Yes! Now I just have to convince them that just because they're vaccinated doesn't mean they can gallivant around
30/01/2021, 09:54 - +44 7752 359588: And by they, I mean my mom
30/01/2021, 09:55 - +44 7752 359588: Although my dad may treat himself to an extra grocery store trip once he's fully vaccinated
30/01/2021, 09:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Great news!
30/01/2021, 10:01 - +44 7462 872590: Ha yeah. My Grandma got the first dose a week ago and wants to see us in Feb. We had to explain that's not how it works.
30/01/2021, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: They know that they need to wait a few weeks post second dose, but I feel like after that my mom is going to want to see everyone
30/01/2021, 10:02 - +44 7752 359588: Even though no one else will be vaccinated
30/01/2021, 10:07 - +44 7462 872590: I wish the govt would be more clear (as if that's ever gonna happen) and say that lockdowns will be relaxed when X% of the population is vaccinated. Unless of course you need to test your eyesight while driving your child to a castle, if you have a legit reason it fine.
30/01/2021, 10:10 - +44 7752 359588: Haaaaa
30/01/2021, 10:10 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah more guidance would be great
30/01/2021, 10:11 - +44 7752 359588: There's a vaccine centre that's just opened up round the corner from us - saw people queueing for the first time yesterday!

05/02/2021, 21:30 - +44 7752 359588: I thought he might be older
05/02/2021, 21:30 - +44 7752 359588: Hes been around for ages
05/02/2021, 21:30 - +44 7752 359588: Also he doesn't look that young?
05/02/2021, 21:31 - +44 7462 872590: He's definitely a shape shifting lizard person
05/02/2021, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: I mean accurate
05/02/2021, 21:32 - +61 474 759 280: Genuinely thought he was late 20s
05/02/2021, 21:32 - +61 474 759 280: He sounds like it
05/02/2021, 21:32 - +44 7462 872590: So he's probably only 30 in lizard years
05/02/2021, 21:32 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôd only come across him in The Trump Years
05/02/2021, 21:33 - +61 474 759 280: (Tm)

05/02/2021, 22:09 - +44 7752 359588: Does the sun damage just make everyone in their 20s look 50? Have you forgotten what youth looks like?
05/02/2021, 22:09 - +61 474 759 280: I guess the sun really does some damage here
05/02/2021, 22:09 - James Kemp: Johnny shagging 60 year olds who tell him they‚Äôre 25

06/02/2021, 23:41 - James Kemp: Hoping we‚Äôll see a lot of upbeat songs as a response to corona

10/02/2021, 16:03 - +44 7752 359588: Which means somewhere on the internet, my future best friend exists

11/02/2021, 10:51 - +44 7752 359588: Otherwise, we are still in the throws of norway's selection process and I think the danish contest is also starting
11/02/2021, 10:51 - +44 7752 359588: But don't know if we are getting any more actual song confirmations yet
11/02/2021, 10:52 - +44 7752 359588: A few of the panel selected artists are releasing their songs towards the end of Feb I think
11/02/2021, 10:54 - +44 7752 359588: Also will recommend checking out the german artist on instagram
11/02/2021, 10:54 - +44 7752 359588: Hes goofy
11/02/2021, 11:03 - James Kemp: liz you really are a fountain of knowledge hot damn

12/02/2021, 07:56 - +44 7752 359588: Oh no!!! I imagine this is more preemptive than aus being a shit show like us?
12/02/2021, 07:56 - +44 7752 359588: Is it full on lockdown then?
12/02/2021, 08:06 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah we‚Äôve got 17 cases

12/02/2021, 15:18 - +44 7752 359588: I wonder how much I could pay him to just follow me around and be my hype man
12/02/2021, 15:19 - +44 7752 359588: It could definitely be worse
12/02/2021, 15:19 - +44 7752 359588: https://youtu.be/uvdjQkaQ1cs
12/02/2021, 15:19 - +44 7752 359588: This is the trainwreck from 2018 that didn't get selected
12/02/2021, 15:19 - +44 7752 359588: It will give you your Friday laughs
12/02/2021, 15:21 - James Kemp: he's got like a really affected american-ish accent?
12/02/2021, 15:21 - James Kemp: also his kind of non-vocal vibing for the first min while she sings feels like big md energy
12/02/2021, 15:21 - James Kemp: just quietly but happily pranging out
12/02/2021, 15:23 - James Kemp: and THIS? this is rebecca black's mum buying her a eurovision slot i swear

12/02/2021, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Accurate
12/02/2021, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: It makes me chuckle a lot
12/02/2021, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Also - could you say the word bitch in a eurovision song?
12/02/2021, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Seems like it would need to be censored
12/02/2021, 15:24 - James Kemp: yeah i gagged
12/02/2021, 15:24 - James Kemp: maybe this was her hometown competition where the rules are more lax
12/02/2021, 15:24 - James Kemp: hometown lmao, home country
12/02/2021, 15:24 - +44 7752 359588: Actually this gives me less Friday and more My Jeans, which is definitely worse

12/02/2021, 15:26 - +44 7752 359588: Is daz Sampson pitbull adjacent? Like is he the cheapest pitbull knock off ever (ignoring that he obviously predates Pitbull)
12/02/2021, 15:26 - +44 7752 359588: Basically I am asking if that explains why I'm a little into him
12/02/2021, 15:27 - James Kemp: 100%
12/02/2021, 15:27 - James Kemp: arguably too old for the demographic he's trying to serve - tick

12/02/2021, 15:30 - +44 7752 359588: Tonight, being a classic example
12/02/2021, 15:30 - James Kemp: yes he does!

12/02/2021, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: But also more attainable?
12/02/2021, 15:31 - James Kemp: yeah i feel like the consent rating is much lower with daz
12/02/2021, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: I guess cause he's less famous
12/02/2021, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: CAN YOU TELL I WANT TO DO NO WORK TODAY
12/02/2021, 15:31 - James Kemp: i feel like the 'but' is superfluous here
12/02/2021, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha fair point
12/02/2021, 15:32 - James Kemp: we should run a ted talk, liz
12/02/2021, 15:33 - James Kemp: and just to make some kind of point (idk what), we should present it as a pair and you will be the skeezy butch presence and i will be a scantily clad ho in boots
12/02/2021, 15:33 - James Kemp: you can non-verbally vibe whilst i deliver my sermon on daz/pitbull
12/02/2021, 15:34 - James Kemp: before letting out your own verse solely in the medium of belch
12/02/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: The only good ted talk in the world
12/02/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: I'll just give you a YEEEAAAH after every sentence
12/02/2021, 15:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Hahaha Liz
12/02/2021, 15:45 - Reuben Yarwood: He looks like a guy who's still dancing in the corner of a club on Sunday morning after the lights have been turned on and everyone else has gone home
12/02/2021, 15:47 - +44 7752 359588: This feels incredibly accurate
13/02/2021, 00:15 - +61 474 759 280: Just saw the ABC showing an England flag icon instead of üá¨üáß for a hotel quarantine news story
13/02/2021, 10:23 - +44 7752 359588: Oh dear

16/02/2021, 10:46 - James Kemp: just bcoz of how sh00ky it gets
16/02/2021, 10:46 - +61 474 759 280: It hasn‚Äôt got too spook yet

16/02/2021, 11:10 - +61 474 759 280: @447912940213 apparently Darcy was originally going to be named Ambrosius
16/02/2021, 11:10 - +61 474 759 280: Very niche Labyrinth reference I believe
16/02/2021, 11:42 - +61 474 759 280: Ok I just tried to play it and got up to when you find the clipboard with your conversation with Delilah

16/02/2021, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: I'm sure my christian interview panelist is going to love that
16/02/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: hun that's great but why do we need to know?
16/02/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: s e p a r a t e y o i d e n t i t i e s
16/02/2021, 11:53 - +44 7752 359588: It's one way she plans to get involved in the local community I guess
16/02/2021, 11:53 - +44 7752 359588: Meeting the other pagans in York
16/02/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: ohhh right
16/02/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: the booming neopagan polytheist and witch community
16/02/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: this quote from a client's colleague survey spoke to the core of my soul
16/02/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: "Too busy to get anything done!"
16/02/2021, 11:55 - +44 7752 359588: Too real
16/02/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: what a beautiful oxymoron
16/02/2021, 11:56 - Reuben Yarwood: My hobbies include stealing and  sacrificing children and knitting
16/02/2021, 11:57 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I have more time for that than for the 100th student who tells me they want to visit museums
16/02/2021, 11:57 - Reuben Yarwood: I was going to say, I feel like this could land quite well with you Liz
16/02/2021, 11:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Did they mention renaissance fairs?
16/02/2021, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: I mean, would I join their coven? Maybe
16/02/2021, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: Shit lots of people talk about joining a church in their application, if she wants to find a new coven, get it
16/02/2021, 12:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Would give you a great excuse to wear the cape
16/02/2021, 12:03 - Aaron Ayling: @447585334190 how's the job sitch btw?

16/02/2021, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: It was fun! You missed Aaron and I playing the world's most frustrating match game - you had to match the same black and white faces in a row.
16/02/2021, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: Let me tell you that was not a faceblind friendly game
16/02/2021, 13:00 - Aaron Ayling: Hahaha fucking hell

16/02/2021, 19:18 - Reuben Yarwood: There ain't no apocalypse
Long as you're here on my lips
16/02/2021, 19:19 - Reuben Yarwood: I feel like, as someone single during lockdown and cautiously attempting a few socially distanced dates, this is sending the wrong message
16/02/2021, 19:20 - Reuben Yarwood: "we both need to feel love nothing wrong with that"
16/02/2021, 19:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Imagine this was a female singer
16/02/2021, 19:21 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
16/02/2021, 19:21 - +44 7752 359588: I think it has tune potential!

17/02/2021, 10:10 - Sam Lea: Love a book that tears Australia apart
17/02/2021, 10:10 - James Kemp: i am glad the big hetero energy of that book is being offset by some peach juice
17/02/2021, 10:10 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs very masc isn‚Äôt it
17/02/2021, 10:11 - James Kemp: yeah it scares me

17/02/2021, 10:33 - +44 7752 359588: Do you have a full set? Feels very adult
17/02/2021, 10:34 - +61 474 759 280: Thank you! I bought a set second hand. Made in Japan in the 80s
17/02/2021, 10:34 - +61 474 759 280: $25 (~¬£14)
17/02/2021, 10:35 - +44 7752 359588: You might be the only person I know who uses the saucer with the teacup and I have a lot of respect for that
17/02/2021, 10:36 - +61 474 759 280: I had a bit of spillage too
17/02/2021, 10:36 - +61 474 759 280: Saved the day
17/02/2021, 11:27 - +44 7752 359588: My application highlights of today: one girl talking about how customizing her neopets page to be as excessively tacky as possible got her into coding
17/02/2021, 11:28 - +44 7752 359588: Another reference letter from an italian professor saying that a student is a good cultural ambassador because she made her study abroad classmates watch Hocus Pocus "a typical US halloween film"
17/02/2021, 11:28 - +61 474 759 280: Are these people trolling?
17/02/2021, 11:28 - +61 474 759 280: Surely
17/02/2021, 11:28 - +44 7752 359588: Nope
17/02/2021, 11:28 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I am totally there for the neopets story
17/02/2021, 11:29 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like a lot of people our generation got interested in coding from shit like that
17/02/2021, 11:29 - +44 7752 359588: Myspace, etc
17/02/2021, 11:29 - +44 7752 359588: This girl really gave details tho - the cursor was apparently a wand and she had animated snow falling down the page
17/02/2021, 11:30 - +61 474 759 280: Sounds legit
17/02/2021, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: I mean she has a patent and 3 more pending, so it seems to have served her well
17/02/2021, 11:31 - +61 474 759 280: What‚Äôs the patent?
17/02/2021, 11:33 - +44 7752 359588: Some breathing device thing for musicians?
17/02/2021, 11:34 - +44 7752 359588: Helps them get their breath in time to perform better I think
17/02/2021, 11:34 - +44 7752 359588: She's a computational music person ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
17/02/2021, 11:34 - +61 474 759 280: Niche!
17/02/2021, 11:35 - James Kemp: omg this is such a vibe
17/02/2021, 11:35 - James Kemp: i had a snow themed shop, and it took me to the deep fucking web of coding to figure out how to get rid of the black border around the items i was selling
17/02/2021, 11:35 - +44 7752 359588: Loool
17/02/2021, 11:35 - James Kemp: so i could save up fort the map pieces for the lab ray obv
17/02/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: and i remember you could write the name for your merchant who greeted your customers
17/02/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: and mine was called "the ubiquitous rudegirl"
17/02/2021, 11:47 - +44 7752 359588: Ahahaha that is amazing
17/02/2021, 11:47 - +44 7752 359588: Also that's some big vocab for a neopets shop
17/02/2021, 11:48 - +44 7752 359588: I was not nearly so fancy - didn't really customize shit
17/02/2021, 11:48 - James Kemp: i was probably into it way too late
17/02/2021, 11:48 - James Kemp: like 12/13?
17/02/2021, 11:48 - Reuben Yarwood: How old were you? Great word
17/02/2021, 11:48 - James Kemp: i had to get my dad to fax off permission because i didn't understand that on the itnernet you could just lie
17/02/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: and oddly enough they accepted faxes but not emails?
17/02/2021, 11:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Japan called
17/02/2021, 11:49 - Reuben Yarwood: *Japan faxed
17/02/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: also, username was...
17/02/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: tainted_james
17/02/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: YAAAAAAAAAS repression
17/02/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: anyway, hope you have all enjoyed this neopets chronicle
17/02/2021, 11:50 - Aaron Ayling: https://youtu.be/YWdD206eSv0
17/02/2021, 11:50 - Aaron Ayling: I also learned a lot of html coding from neopets!
17/02/2021, 11:51 - Aaron Ayling: I had an mp3 player playing It's a beautiful day by u2
17/02/2021, 11:52 - James Kemp: another sign of innocent youth
17/02/2021, 11:52 - James Kemp: not thinking bono is a cunt
17/02/2021, 11:53 - +44 7752 359588: Lool
17/02/2021, 11:54 - +44 7752 359588: Yes I think 12 was about the end of my neopets experience
17/02/2021, 11:54 - +44 7752 359588: I will never get over your faxed permission story to be fair
17/02/2021, 11:54 - James Kemp: i was still playing dragonball z in the playground at that age
17/02/2021, 11:54 - James Kemp: took me a while
17/02/2021, 11:54 - +44 7752 359588: Although the closest I ever got to being internet groomed was on neopets, so probs good to have parental permission
17/02/2021, 11:57 - +61 474 759 280: That is so so great
17/02/2021, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: Ok next application: queering ecopoetry
17/02/2021, 12:02 - +44 7752 359588: This dude apparently got to perform at end of the road in 2007
17/02/2021, 12:03 - +44 7752 359588: But he has also definitely misused the word "innit" in an attempt to sound like a british person üëç
17/02/2021, 12:03 - James Kemp: how did he use it?
17/02/2021, 12:03 - +44 7752 359588: "Americans know so little about life outside their own country, innit?"
17/02/2021, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: Like not the most wrong
17/02/2021, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: But innit is also just an abbreviation of isn't it
17/02/2021, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: Which does not make sense here
17/02/2021, 12:05 - James Kemp: and it's just weird in writing
17/02/2021, 12:23 - Reuben Yarwood: It's like writing "Y'all aren't ready for me America!" on an application for a masters in the US. Seems a bit forced!
17/02/2021, 12:24 - Reuben Yarwood: My EcoPoetry is so lit
17/02/2021, 12:24 - James Kemp: or "if you don't give me this grant i will be    SAD !"
17/02/2021, 12:26 - +44 7752 359588: I mean americans write all sorts of nonsense in a personal statement
17/02/2021, 12:26 - +44 7752 359588: Just read one where a marine biologist talks about coming out to his best friend sophomore year and how supportive they were
17/02/2021, 12:26 - +44 7752 359588: Which is great
17/02/2021, 12:27 - +44 7752 359588: But also was kind of irrelevant to everything else...
17/02/2021, 12:27 - +44 7752 359588: Still nothing tops the guy last year who talked about the farm he grew up on and watching his favorite chicken get killed
17/02/2021, 12:28 - +44 7752 359588: RIP Fireball the chicken
17/02/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: yeah wtf is all this
17/02/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: is it just a huge cultural difference in how americans and brits approach the personal statement?
17/02/2021, 12:32 - Reuben Yarwood: 10/10 name for a chicken
17/02/2021, 12:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Lived hard and fast
17/02/2021, 12:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Tasted delicious
17/02/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: Yep! Americans are told to share personality, but it frequently just becomes a life story sob fest
17/02/2021, 12:33 - +44 7752 359588: Which is sometimes useful, because it can give context - like I read one from a girl who grew up in foster care, and it mostly just explained why her grades had been a bit shit before
17/02/2021, 12:33 - +44 7752 359588: But also sometimes it goes really off the raild
17/02/2021, 12:34 - +61 474 759 280: And overcoming disadvantage, totally makes sense
17/02/2021, 12:34 - +61 474 759 280: Watching the assassination of Fireball the chicken though
17/02/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: yeah i feel like y'all are messy af
17/02/2021, 12:34 - +61 474 759 280: Enough
17/02/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: like unless it is relevant, stfu with the theatrics
17/02/2021, 12:35 - James Kemp: this ain't the x factor
17/02/2021, 16:11 - James Kemp: @447912940213 are you parents okay in these texas storms?
17/02/2021, 16:11 - James Kemp: got a client getting bummed
17/02/2021, 20:15 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
17/02/2021, 20:15 - James Kemp: (Abby‚Äôs book)
17/02/2021, 20:16 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúFor sharing the earliest excitement‚Äù (cut that bit off)
17/02/2021, 20:29 - Reuben Yarwood: V cool
17/02/2021, 20:30 - Reuben Yarwood: How come you get James and Jim Roberts gets Jim?
17/02/2021, 20:30 - Reuben Yarwood: You should demand a reprint
17/02/2021, 20:31 - Aaron Ayling: Nice!
17/02/2021, 20:31 - +44 7462 872590: So cool!!
17/02/2021, 20:55 - James Kemp: I mean, a bit annoyed that I‚Äôm not in the ‚Äúespecially‚Äù section
17/02/2021, 20:55 - James Kemp: üåö
17/02/2021, 20:56 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ
17/02/2021, 20:56 - +44 7462 872590: Where was the character named after you?!
17/02/2021, 20:56 - James Kemp: Also didn‚Äôt deliver on that
17/02/2021, 20:57 - James Kemp: Wtf Abby
17/02/2021, 22:03 - +44 7752 359588: Ahhh that's so cool!
17/02/2021, 22:03 - +44 7752 359588: Also you come before pascoe
17/02/2021, 22:03 - +44 7752 359588: Hope you gloat about that
18/02/2021, 06:54 - +61 474 759 280: So Facebook has banned all Australian news on their platform
18/02/2021, 06:56 - +61 474 759 280: Making Kyle and Jackie O our largest national news source https://youtu.be/EFqmrn2o9DM
18/02/2021, 06:57 - +61 474 759 280: Kyle is kind of a festier Australian version of Piers Morgan
18/02/2021, 08:31 - +44 7752 359588: Whaaat
18/02/2021, 08:31 - +44 7752 359588: That's wild
18/02/2021, 09:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow. Are they making an example of Aus or something? What's the reasoning behind it?
18/02/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: Cannot ducking believe this is a govt ad https://twitter.com/ukhomeoffice/status/1362107043847503872?s=24
18/02/2021, 12:41 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah this feels like huge news - what's the reasoning?
18/02/2021, 12:42 - James Kemp: it's at least kind of tongue in cheek, no?
18/02/2021, 12:42 - James Kemp: like, clearly riffing of those piracy ads from the 90s
18/02/2021, 12:42 - Aaron Ayling: YOU WOULDN'T STEAL A CAR
18/02/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: We passed legislation for google and facebook to pay publishers a fee for hosting their content. As a counter punch Facebook pulled all Australian content
18/02/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: Fwiw: I don‚Äôt believe in the legislation, feels like the fed govt cosying up to new corp
18/02/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: News*
18/02/2021, 12:44 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
18/02/2021, 12:45 - Sam Lea: delicious Aussie bevvies
18/02/2021, 12:45 - +61 474 759 280: We will be the first Bing Nation
18/02/2021, 12:46 - +61 474 759 280: And I am ON BOARD
18/02/2021, 12:47 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs just the fucking gall
18/02/2021, 12:48 - +61 474 759 280: 100,000+ deaths, and you have the balls to make this
18/02/2021, 12:52 - Reuben Yarwood: Ah not the prompting genocide stuff then
18/02/2021, 12:58 - Sam Lea: I feel like... aping the 90s piracy ads in this slightly memey way sets totally the wrong tone? Slightly glamourizes the stuff it's prohibiting for its target audience?
18/02/2021, 13:17 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah coz everyone thought that the arguments in the piracy ads were fucking stupid (e.g. I probably would steal a car if the original car was left completely intact and I got a perfect copy of said car)
18/02/2021, 13:18 - Aaron Ayling: So it kind of draws parallels with shit arguments
18/02/2021, 13:20 - +61 474 759 280: Anything short of a state leader personally pleading the public to follow the rules is a pisstake, but in this instance it‚Äôs particularly irritating
18/02/2021, 13:24 - +61 474 759 280: If the government was serious they couldn‚Äôt rally the whole of the media to broadcast a prime minister‚Äôs message on repeats with direct messaging until it gets through. Stylistic campaigns that blame the public are pathetic
18/02/2021, 13:24 - +61 474 759 280: Sorry, ending rant now
18/02/2021, 13:25 - +61 474 759 280: Also couldn‚Äôt= could
18/02/2021, 13:43 - James Kemp: RANT AWAY, SIS
18/02/2021, 13:43 - James Kemp: Yeah I hadn‚Äôt really considered this angle tbf
18/02/2021, 13:44 - James Kemp: I guess I just immediately discount and eye roll at anything the government says
18/02/2021, 13:44 - James Kemp: But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not important to do it right
18/02/2021, 14:33 - James Kemp: @447752359588 DO U HAVE ANY APPLICATION HIGHLIGHTS 4 US TODAY??
18/02/2021, 14:35 - Aaron Ayling: One she highlighted to me was that they have to list any time they'd spent in the UK previously, and some dude's only entry was "3 hour layover in Heathrow in 2010"
18/02/2021, 14:35 - James Kemp: üòÖ
18/02/2021, 14:36 - James Kemp: also also UK SNATCH GAME tonight
18/02/2021, 15:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Pumped!
18/02/2021, 16:15 - +44 7752 359588: One of my interview panelists definitely faked wifi issues so she could turn her camera off to have a cigarette
18/02/2021, 16:35 - Reuben Yarwood: One of the interviewers?
18/02/2021, 17:32 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
18/02/2021, 18:09 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
18/02/2021, 18:09 - +44 7752 359588: Yes!
18/02/2021, 18:10 - +44 7752 359588: Bold interview moves so far:
18/02/2021, 18:10 - +44 7752 359588: Yesterday a candidate started off by asking us to play a word association game
18/02/2021, 18:10 - +44 7752 359588: It was a bold opening gambit that did not ultimately pay off
18/02/2021, 18:11 - +44 7752 359588: And today, when they had time for questions, a candidate asked us very awkwardly what we most remembered about her from the interview
18/02/2021, 18:11 - +44 7752 359588: None of the interviewers appreciated that
18/02/2021, 18:14 - Reuben Yarwood: That is a weird one. It's like the main thing she's trying to get out of it isn't the job, it's the interview practice
18/02/2021, 18:15 - James Kemp: This is 100/10
18/02/2021, 18:15 - +44 7752 359588: It was clearly some real bad interview advice she had read somewhere I think
18/02/2021, 18:16 - Reuben Yarwood: I've only got one question: _are you ready for me?_
18/02/2021, 18:17 - James Kemp: I would hire this person
19/02/2021, 05:45 - +61 474 759 280: Wow I missed PJ stepping down from Reply All
19/02/2021, 07:58 - Reuben Yarwood: Woah, big news! Who's going to do his manic laugh now?
19/02/2021, 07:59 - +61 474 759 280: *dusts off resume*
19/02/2021, 08:10 - +44 7752 359588: In today's eurovision news: the uk is just putting forward the same dude as last year
19/02/2021, 08:10 - +44 7752 359588: Song tbd
19/02/2021, 08:11 - +44 7752 359588: Given how secretive they've been, I'm very disappointed it's just mr. My last BREATH
19/02/2021, 10:24 - +44 7752 359588: How does the chat feel about the term: thought leader?
19/02/2021, 10:24 - +44 7752 359588: It's wanky right?
19/02/2021, 10:33 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah but I'm not sure of a better concise way of conveying that meaning so kind of just accept it
19/02/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: I mean what's wrong with just saying leader?
19/02/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: Or a leading mind?
19/02/2021, 10:41 - +44 7752 359588: I don't know why it doggers me so much, but it does
19/02/2021, 10:43 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah this is good
19/02/2021, 11:36 - Reuben Yarwood: What's the difference between leader and thought leader?
19/02/2021, 11:36 - Reuben Yarwood: Just sounds a bit 1984 to me
19/02/2021, 12:06 - James Kemp: 100% hell
19/02/2021, 12:26 - +44 7752 359588: This applicant just wants to get involved in TEDxGlasgow
19/02/2021, 12:26 - +44 7752 359588: DOGGERED
19/02/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: Dani and I watched But I‚Äôm A Cheerleader (amazon prime) yday

19/02/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: A bigole dose of camp nostalgia that doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously
19/02/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: Oh not very
19/02/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: More just in the characters and the slightly offbeat vibe rather than the grossness
19/02/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Fun!
19/02/2021, 13:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds excellent
19/02/2021, 13:05 - +61 474 759 280: I say ‚Äúthought leader‚Äù to myself when I press the STOP button on the bus immediately after it‚Äôs left the stop prior to the one I want to get off at
19/02/2021, 13:05 - +61 474 759 280: Sorry catching up on chat
19/02/2021, 13:06 - James Kemp: Ooh no that‚Äôs way too soon
19/02/2021, 13:06 - James Kemp: I worry that sends the message ‚ÄúI wanted to get off at that stop and you left too soon‚Äù
19/02/2021, 13:06 - +61 474 759 280: Guess you‚Äôre not a thought leader
19/02/2021, 13:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Does this mean your a thought follower?
19/02/2021, 13:07 - James Kemp: Clearly!!
19/02/2021, 13:07 - Reuben Yarwood: You're. Dammit I'm one too
19/02/2021, 13:07 - James Kemp: I am the sheep, you are the farmer
19/02/2021, 13:07 - James Kemp: Meet me in Wales, big boy
19/02/2021, 13:12 - +61 474 759 280: Damn I had my first dinner party with my housemates friends and it was a lot but not in a seshy way
19/02/2021, 13:13 - James Kemp: Go on...?
19/02/2021, 13:14 - +61 474 759 280: All church goers, of different churches. Guy I got stuck with was by far the most unhinged and explained at lengths the supremacy of Protestantism over Catholicism. Also very into Aussie rules football which is somehow more unappealing
19/02/2021, 13:14 - James Kemp: Oh god
19/02/2021, 13:14 - Reuben Yarwood: üòë
19/02/2021, 13:15 - James Kemp: Are you being groomed?
19/02/2021, 13:15 - +61 474 759 280: there was an obvious vibe between my housemate and a single girl there, my housemate‚Äôs gf later told me she treated her like they‚Äôd never met even though she‚Äôs been to her house multiple times and they‚Äôre friends on Facebook
19/02/2021, 13:16 - +61 474 759 280: If so they‚Äôre doing just a terrible job
19/02/2021, 13:17 - Reuben Yarwood: A Christian love triangle?

19/02/2021, 13:34 - +61 474 759 280: Far out

21/02/2021, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: I mean the staging really did it for me
21/02/2021, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: Someone on the eurovision subreddit pointed out that  one of the devils will need to be cut for the actual contest
21/02/2021, 14:52 - +44 7752 359588: But then you'll have 5, so at least they can form a pentagram
21/02/2021, 15:01 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm also pretty into it. It didn't sound that live though? Like sounded as if he was singing along with multiple prerecorded versions of himself?

22/02/2021, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: I interviewed her last year and thought she sucked then, and she sucks even more now

22/02/2021, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Over my dead body is she getting this award
22/02/2021, 12:22 - James Kemp: ruin her
22/02/2021, 12:23 - James Kemp: what award is she applying for?
22/02/2021, 12:23 - James Kemp: like why is she going so ham on capitalism?

22/02/2021, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: Her whole thing is affordable housing
22/02/2021, 12:24 - +44 7752 359588: And like she's going on about how great council housing is.... is that not kind of socialist?
22/02/2021, 12:24 - James Kemp: right?
22/02/2021, 12:40 - Aaron Ayling: What a privaleged cunt
22/02/2021, 12:54 - Reuben Yarwood: "socialism, anemic" phew!
22/02/2021, 12:55 - Reuben Yarwood: Why does she need an MSc then if it's already a done deal?
22/02/2021, 12:56 - Reuben Yarwood: And also she's applying for a scholarship. If she believes in capitalism and socialism is amenic then pay for your god damn masters
22/02/2021, 12:59 - +61 474 759 280: Brainwashed but with a totally incoherent take. SAD !

23/02/2021, 10:19 - Sam Lea: 'to determine how many things' denotes a clipboard, a tally... a guinness world record attempt, perhaps?
23/02/2021, 10:20 - James Kemp: yes, she's definitely dealing in countable nouns
23/02/2021, 10:20 - James Kemp: she don't want love

23/02/2021, 14:10 - Reuben Yarwood: Just feels so out of the realms of possibility that we could all be in the same room together getting mad wae it
23/02/2021, 14:10 - James Kemp: yeah i know - obviously life is one big caveat, but i can't help but get excited at the possibility

23/02/2021, 14:37 - Aaron Ayling: But very nice to have these possibilities on the horizon
23/02/2021, 14:55 - +44 7462 872590: My birthday is also around then, so hope to make it down for some summer shenanigans. (Pitching Summer Shenanigans as a drag name).

23/02/2021, 16:21 - +44 7752 359588: Shall I just show up to all parties in a massive bubble?
23/02/2021, 16:21 - +44 7752 359588: Or make out with everyone there
23/02/2021, 16:22 - +44 7752 359588: I think I'm swinging to one extreme or the other basically
23/02/2021, 16:22 - +44 7752 359588: Also about to interview a 78 year old japanese lady for a phd!

23/02/2021, 16:24 - +44 7752 359588: Think it's called boko?
23/02/2021, 16:24 - +44 7752 359588: About how it's being viewed in the art world against the backdrop of sustainability and environmentalism
23/02/2021, 16:24 - +44 7752 359588: She seems sickening

01/03/2021, 12:10 - +44 7752 359588: Today I am interviewing someone who is a trained victorian type setter and broom factory worker
01/03/2021, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: I guess for living history things?
01/03/2021, 12:11 - James Kemp: or maybe they're from another time?
01/03/2021, 12:11 - James Kemp: like a genuine victorian
01/03/2021, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: I mean that would be sickening
01/03/2021, 12:12 - +44 7752 359588: Although if you were a legit victorian I feel like the last place you'd want to go would be birmingham (no shade Aaron)
01/03/2021, 12:12 - Aaron Ayling: Birmingham is trash don't worry
01/03/2021, 12:13 - James Kemp: well, that surely adds credence to the theory
01/03/2021, 12:13 - James Kemp: we can't expect victorian time travel technology to get it right first time?
01/03/2021, 12:13 - James Kemp: only an actual victorian would think birmingham was a land of plenty?
01/03/2021, 12:14 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha a land of opportunity for broom factory workers
01/03/2021, 12:16 - James Kemp: they FINALLY confirmed my leaving date

01/03/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: so they could figure out that bullshit proposal to come back to me with
01/03/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: which i rejected
01/03/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: i was worried they weren't gonna let me take the hol which would mean i had 6 more days to work
01/03/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: but they came good on that, at least
01/03/2021, 12:20 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh very good
01/03/2021, 12:21 - Aaron Ayling: They would have had to pay you out if not though eh? But yeah I get that an extra 6 days pay doesn't necessarily mean much when you just wanna get the fook oot
01/03/2021, 12:21 - Aaron Ayling: TG good riddance
01/03/2021, 12:21 - Aaron Ayling: How's the career coach been?
01/03/2021, 12:21 - James Kemp: yeah they would've

01/03/2021, 12:22 - James Kemp: good, so far! done some interesting exercises together which have felt like a very specific form of therapy which i've found quite interesting
01/03/2021, 12:22 - James Kemp: about what i learned about working from observing my mum/dad as a kid
01/03/2021, 12:23 - James Kemp: still in the therapy stage, rather than the practical recommendations, but am enjoying!
01/03/2021, 12:24 - Aaron Ayling: Sounds like it'll be a valuable building block

02/03/2021, 09:53 - +44 7752 359588: One of the people I'm interviewing wrote about captain planet in their essay, so obvs gonna select them
02/03/2021, 10:02 - James Kemp: wait didn't we decide we hated gimmicky covid comms?
02/03/2021, 10:02 - James Kemp: i am ready to be put in my place üåö
02/03/2021, 10:03 - James Kemp: üî•
02/03/2021, 10:04 - James Kemp: (it's a bop btw)
02/03/2021, 10:13 - James Kemp: who is captain planet?? üôà
02/03/2021, 10:14 - James Kemp: oh wow this shit is woke
02/03/2021, 10:19 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I think imo it's okay if the government responsible for it haven't royally fucked up and have the worst death rate in the world on their hands?
02/03/2021, 10:19 - James Kemp: sure it's definitely _better_, but surely the principle still stands
02/03/2021, 10:19 - Aaron Ayling: Like if you have the best covid response in the world you can behave however you want coz you've earned it
02/03/2021, 10:19 - James Kemp: hmm
02/03/2021, 10:20 - James Kemp: i'm not trying to be spicy - i just thought y'all made a fair point on the last one so trying to understand the difference
02/03/2021, 10:20 - James Kemp: i guess that's a part of it - still seems in a similar enough vain to be a little icky tho?
02/03/2021, 10:21 - James Kemp: like people are still dying + club banger
02/03/2021, 10:22 - Aaron Ayling: I think the big sticking point in the UK one for me was equating  the message to the piracy ads - ie arguments that fall down upon closer inspection and were widely ignored by the populace. I don't have a problem with gimmicky covid messaging, I just had a problem with that specific instance.
02/03/2021, 10:23 - Aaron Ayling: I take the point that one can argue all gimmicky covid ads are wrong though
02/03/2021, 10:23 - James Kemp: yeah i don't really have my own opinion solidified tbh - just interested in what johnny's take was as the covid comms man
02/03/2021, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs the fact the uk ad was guilting individuals and comparing unsafe behaviour to video piracy
02/03/2021, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: Ie watch this, feel bad, do what we‚Äôre asking of you
02/03/2021, 10:24 - +61 474 759 280: When they‚Äôve in fact completely fucked the situation up themselves, not the public
02/03/2021, 10:25 - James Kemp: right
02/03/2021, 10:25 - James Kemp: so the nz one in uk would be okay?
02/03/2021, 10:35 - Aaron Ayling: I think I'd still feel a little icky about it (but less bad than the piracy one) as I dont feel our govt have earned the right to do that? But again don't have a fully fledged opinion
02/03/2021, 10:40 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs upbeat, it doesn‚Äôt blame anyone, they‚Äôve also kept their public safe
02/03/2021, 10:40 - +61 474 759 280: So
02/03/2021, 10:41 - +61 474 759 280: ü§ò
02/03/2021, 10:43 - +61 474 759 280: They‚Äôve earned the right to take license with their messaging
02/03/2021, 10:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Looks like they've taken this down actually
02/03/2021, 10:50 - James Kemp: Yeah no I agree!
02/03/2021, 10:51 - James Kemp: And less sure about this

02/03/2021, 17:23 - +44 7752 359588: Interviewed a guy wearing a bolo tie
02/03/2021, 17:23 - +44 7752 359588: He is navajo so it is a less bold move perhaps

04/03/2021, 22:30 - +44 7752 359588: The dancing ice cream is great as is the small goop at the end

05/03/2021, 00:07 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently the moldovans are big homophobes too
05/03/2021, 00:07 - James Kemp: The song isn‚Äôt the best, but what it‚Äôs packaged in is great
05/03/2021, 00:07 - +44 7752 359588: Like at the announcement livestream the weird presenter said some messed up shit about conchita

09/03/2021, 12:25 - Reuben Yarwood: The Royal family wondered how white the kid would be. And Megan had a hard time fitting in. Does not seem huge news?
09/03/2021, 12:25 - James Kemp: Hmm maybe not in itself
09/03/2021, 12:26 - James Kemp: But I guess the gag is just that it‚Äôs all being aired in public
09/03/2021, 12:26 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm not condoning it
09/03/2021, 12:26 - James Kemp: You imagine these things happening in the shady world we don‚Äôt see for sure

09/03/2021, 12:28 - +44 7462 872590: A great joke set up
09/03/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: Yeah but how often is it that somebody with that much access just comes out and _reads_?
09/03/2021, 12:28 - Reuben Yarwood: Like its not news that they're old and rasist
09/03/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: Philip is obviously a racist
09/03/2021, 12:28 - Reuben Yarwood: Racist
09/03/2021, 12:29 - James Kemp: Megan reading them the house down boots is pretty gaggy
09/03/2021, 12:29 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm living
09/03/2021, 12:29 - +44 7462 872590: I guess it highlights the protection the Royals still have... Especially when it comes to Prince Andrew
09/03/2021, 12:29 - +61 474 759 280: Phillip also asked an indigenous woman in ‚Äò05 why she hadn‚Äôt brought her spear to a function in Sydney
09/03/2021, 12:29 - Reuben Yarwood: ‚ÄúThe Philippines must be half-empty as you‚Äôre all here running the NHS‚Äù (on meeting a Filipino nurse at Luton and Dunstable Hospital).
09/03/2021, 12:30 - Reuben Yarwood: ^Another classic
09/03/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: But who else with access has ever called them out so publicly?

09/03/2021, 12:30 - Reuben Yarwood: V true though
09/03/2021, 12:31 - James Kemp: Like you say, the material ain‚Äôt exactly shocking
09/03/2021, 12:31 - James Kemp: I reckon it was Charlotte who asked about the new baby‚Äôs skin tone

09/03/2021, 12:31 - James Kemp: _imagine_
09/03/2021, 12:31 - James Kemp: Little fucking bitch
09/03/2021, 12:33 - +44 7462 872590: Also the Royal family, even if I don't like it, do represent Britain on some level still. At least that is how they are seen to some people.
09/03/2021, 12:37 - +44 7752 359588: Loool
09/03/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah I'm with jim, the gag is it being aired so openly

09/03/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Online speculation was that it was charles saying all this bushit
09/03/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Because surely no one would have been shocked by it coming from philip
09/03/2021, 12:38 - +61 474 759 280: I say Prince George
09/03/2021, 12:38 - +61 474 759 280: Cancelled age 7

16/03/2021, 09:21 - Sam Lea: Yeah, it was all kicking off round about then wasn't it
16/03/2021, 09:22 - James Kemp: so basically, we do need to add 2 x sam lea birthday celebrations to the post-lockdown party shopping list
16/03/2021, 09:22 - Sam Lea: As such, I shall be requesting two (2) lots of mild-to-moderate sesh as and when I'll next be legally allowed to share the same volume of air as your good selves

16/03/2021, 09:24 - +44 7752 359588: Do two mild-moderate seshes equal one large one? Or like 4 smaller ones? I want the conversion ratio here
16/03/2021, 09:24 - +44 7752 359588: How many pints does one consume?
16/03/2021, 09:24 - James Kemp: yeah i'm gonna be ruthlessly prioritising which seshes i attend, and it only makes the cut if it's moderate at a MINIMUM
16/03/2021, 09:25 - James Kemp: would appreciate some elucidation here, bday boyyye
16/03/2021, 09:25 - Sam Lea: duly noted,

16/03/2021, 09:27 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, these days I think about three beers is getting me to the moderate sesh zone
16/03/2021, 09:28 - +44 7752 359588: Lockdown round three has really made me into a lightweight

16/03/2021, 16:48 - +44 7752 359588: But that's fine haha

16/03/2021, 19:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Lizzo lite?
16/03/2021, 19:20 - Reuben Yarwood: Quite like it. But can't help hoping when she sings "Baby"
16/03/2021, 19:20 - Reuben Yarwood: It just turns "I cant wait tooo looong"

16/03/2021, 19:26 - +44 7752 359588: I think it's to their detriment that think about things came out last year
16/03/2021, 19:26 - +44 7752 359588: If we had never heard them before I think I'd be gagging more
16/03/2021, 19:26 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah, agreed

17/03/2021, 12:11 - James Kemp: I love the idea of just going HAM and using all the features whilst trying to pull that off as some feasible for a call from your living room
17/03/2021, 12:11 - James Kemp: A man crying, construction, a baby crying

17/03/2021, 16:15 - James Kemp: oh WAT
17/03/2021, 16:17 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
17/03/2021, 16:17 - James Kemp: I actually ended up in tears earlier imagining the scenario
17/03/2021, 16:18 - Aaron Ayling: Last full week at work this week right Jim?
17/03/2021, 16:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh like, one by one introducing each sound effect
17/03/2021, 16:18 - James Kemp: Where suddenly someone just has a man crying, a baby crying, construction, a dog barking, someone urinating all in their bedroom
17/03/2021, 16:18 - James Kemp: It floored me
17/03/2021, 16:18 - James Kemp: Yep!
17/03/2021, 16:18 - James Kemp: 3 days left
17/03/2021, 16:18 - Reuben Yarwood: You just keep getting more an more flustered
17/03/2021, 16:19 - James Kemp: Why would there ever be an adult man crying as background noise?!
17/03/2021, 16:19 - Aaron Ayling: My baby is doing construction in an echoey wind tunnel which unfortunately my boyfriend is very attached to and the dog likes to urinate in
17/03/2021, 16:19 - James Kemp: I LOVE IT
17/03/2021, 16:20 - James Kemp: It sounds a lot like the plot to Mother!

18/03/2021, 10:57 - +44 7752 359588: So I like to lurk on a Fulbright applicants slack channel to get the t on what  applicants are saying, what's confusing to them, etc
18/03/2021, 10:57 - +44 7752 359588: And SHIT HAS KICKED OFF
18/03/2021, 10:58 - +44 7752 359588: Two people got super snipey at each other about whether or not memes should be allowed in the main channel
18/03/2021, 10:58 - +44 7752 359588: And then one person starting harrassing the other via DM - unclear who started it, but we did get receipts that person A kept messaging Person B to fuck off
18/03/2021, 10:58 - +44 7752 359588: But then A claimed she was being harassed
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: And now someone has posted Among Us sex memes and is tagging them at Person A
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: Unclear if it was person B or someone else
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: But shit is wild
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: IN A PRESTIGIOUS SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION SLACK
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +61 474 759 280: Fulbright scholars sound like a really disturbed group of people
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: I mean thankfully none of these were candidates for the UK as far as I could tell
18/03/2021, 10:59 - +61 474 759 280: From the shit you‚Äôve told us over the years
18/03/2021, 11:00 - +44 7752 359588: But yes, I hate working with American students
18/03/2021, 11:00 - +44 7752 359588: They are sometimes great, but often also terrible
18/03/2021, 11:00 - +44 7752 359588: I think it was all the Among Us figures fucking that really killed it for me
18/03/2021, 11:01 - +44 7752 359588: It was like 8 or 9 images
18/03/2021, 11:01 - +61 474 759 280: ?????????????
18/03/2021, 11:01 - +44 7752 359588: Someone was just spamming the slack with them
18/03/2021, 11:01 - +44 7752 359588: And tagging person A
18/03/2021, 11:01 - +61 474 759 280: Omg
18/03/2021, 11:12 - Reuben Yarwood: What the hell
18/03/2021, 11:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Why would anyone even have those images to hand?

18/03/2021, 11:33 - James Kemp: clearly not by these fools!
18/03/2021, 11:33 - +44 7752 359588: Thankfully someone did point out that fulbright staff could be watching the chat, but that did not seem to stop anyone
18/03/2021, 11:33 - +44 7752 359588: Haha yes, last year!
18/03/2021, 11:33 - +44 7752 359588: Accidentally joined the UK channel
18/03/2021, 11:34 - +44 7752 359588: I never use my last name, but my display name was Elizabeth
18/03/2021, 11:34 - +44 7752 359588: I am now Mary and I use a black cat icon

18/03/2021, 12:02 - +44 7752 359588: Like she is an icon
18/03/2021, 12:02 - +44 7752 359588: But I never listen to her
18/03/2021, 12:02 - James Kemp: my exact feeling!
18/03/2021, 12:02 - +44 7752 359588: So keen on recs if you have any that particularly come up!

18/03/2021, 14:48 - +44 7752 359588: Isn't it going to just be like an extra bank holiday?
18/03/2021, 14:48 - +44 7752 359588: Presumably government designated
18/03/2021, 14:48 - James Kemp: (i am joking, just to be clear)

18/03/2021, 14:49 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair I've never been here for any of the other weird extra royal holidays so I don't know how it works
18/03/2021, 14:52 - James Kemp: yeah we actually just take them whenever we want - it's like one big holiday booking system at work, cept for the country

18/03/2021, 19:16 - James Kemp: By which I mean, 28 hours on toilet paper focus groups finished and summarised
18/03/2021, 19:16 - James Kemp: üíÄ
18/03/2021, 19:16 - +44 7752 359588: You really know your shit
18/03/2021, 19:16 - +44 7752 359588: Ehhhh
18/03/2021, 19:17 - James Kemp: EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
18/03/2021, 19:17 - James Kemp: I actually don‚Äôt, I stopped listening to the last few groups and just made up the last 25%
18/03/2021, 19:24 - +44 7752 359588: A true vibe
18/03/2021, 19:25 - James Kemp: Delayed reaction to fully endorse this
19/03/2021, 10:39 - +44 7752 359588: BIG NEWS: Our immigration application is officially under review!
19/03/2021, 10:39 - +44 7752 359588: It doesn't mean anything, except that someone is finally looking at it
19/03/2021, 10:39 - +44 7752 359588: But hey, this is literally the first thing we have heard in 10 months
19/03/2021, 10:40 - Reuben Yarwood: Hot damn! That is big news!
19/03/2021, 10:41 - +44 7752 359588: I mean it will likely still be months
19/03/2021, 10:41 - +44 7752 359588: But I'll take it!
19/03/2021, 10:42 - James Kemp: Aiiiiieeeeeeeee!!
19/03/2021, 10:42 - James Kemp: The wheels are slowly turning!
19/03/2021, 10:43 - +44 7752 359588: They're about to do a background check on aaron
19/03/2021, 10:43 - +44 7462 872590: üôå great news!
19/03/2021, 10:43 - +44 7752 359588: So now is the time to flood social media with all the photos of him with ALL THE DRUGS
19/03/2021, 10:44 - James Kemp: What about that one post Straight Nasty where he‚Äôs crapped out on his bed fully clothed with his hand down his pants?
19/03/2021, 10:44 - James Kemp: Would that be a good one
19/03/2021, 10:45 - Aaron Ayling: They already have that Jim - that's the one i sent in with my initial application
19/03/2021, 10:45 - +44 7752 359588: Oh that one we submitted with the application
19/03/2021, 10:45 - +44 7752 359588: God we made the same dumb joke
19/03/2021, 10:45 - Aaron Ayling: hahaha
19/03/2021, 10:45 - James Kemp: Wait I was like
19/03/2021, 10:45 - James Kemp: Are they serious?
19/03/2021, 10:45 - James Kemp: They both said it simultaneously
19/03/2021, 10:45 - Aaron Ayling: haha no we just immediately went to the same joke from different rooms
19/03/2021, 10:46 - +44 7752 359588: This is what happens after a year of marriage where you hardly see anyone else. If we were still living together you would have made the same joke Jim
19/03/2021, 15:30 - James Kemp: oh my gaaad - -just had to take 2 online assessments for this hackney council job
19/03/2021, 15:30 - James Kemp: i think i 100% am not getting through to interview aha
19/03/2021, 15:31 - James Kemp: multiple choice on excel ü§¢
19/03/2021, 15:31 - James Kemp: i was googling my answers, and think i managed to find the answers to most, but then there was a numerical reasoning test... wOMP WOMO
19/03/2021, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: Ewwww whyyyy
19/03/2021, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: (also what even is a numerical reasoning test???)
19/03/2021, 15:32 - James Kemp: loads of charts and data and multiple choice questions
19/03/2021, 15:32 - James Kemp: not mi forte
19/03/2021, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: Oh disguuusting
19/03/2021, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: Same
19/03/2021, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair I would not be into a job where that was a big component
19/03/2021, 15:33 - +44 7752 359588: But that still sucks
19/03/2021, 15:33 - James Kemp: oh yeah, if it somehow got any further and this is what the actual job is like
19/03/2021, 15:33 - James Kemp: no mawma
19/03/2021, 15:34 - James Kemp: i ain't yo number girl
19/03/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: A true vibe
19/03/2021, 15:41 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah sucks that that's on the test but hey if the job is super excelly and numbery anyway doesn't sound much like how they originally pitched it
19/03/2021, 17:26 - Sam Lea: Not that it'll have been at all the same department, but my Hackney Council job interview was also _not_ good lol
19/03/2021, 17:26 - Sam Lea: Oh well, their office rooms were incredibly claustro
19/03/2021, 17:28 - Sam Lea: I was half-contemplating asking to borrow Johnny's Hackney hat, incredibly glad I didn't in the end
19/03/2021, 17:29 - Sam Lea: Sat there sweating in my massively over-keen merch, absolutely bombing in a technical excercise
19/03/2021, 18:05 - +44 7752 359588: I take it back - this actually just got approved! Still have to move to another stage of processing (which I think is also backlogged) but hey! Great news!
19/03/2021, 18:08 - James Kemp: Oh really?? So, at interview not good?
19/03/2021, 18:08 - James Kemp: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm even gonna get that far tbh
19/03/2021, 18:08 - +44 7752 359588: I mean this would have been a real power move
19/03/2021, 18:09 - Sam Lea: Haha might possibly have swung it? "Well, you're massively unqualified for the role, but your heart's visibly in the right place... Congratulations!"
19/03/2021, 18:09 - James Kemp: But the deadline for the presentation I have to do is Sunday, so awkwardly still doing it despite it looking unlikely I‚Äôll ever have to give it
19/03/2021, 18:09 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
19/03/2021, 18:10 - James Kemp: Oooh!! So what‚Äôs the next stage?!
19/03/2021, 18:10 - Sam Lea: How did the other non-numerical bits go?
19/03/2021, 18:10 - James Kemp: It was Excel + numerical; I think google might‚Äôve pulled me through the Excel one, but numerical I think I was probably at like a 50%
19/03/2021, 18:11 - James Kemp: And if I ever have to actually DO any of that excel stuff it‚Äôs a huge lmaoooooo
19/03/2021, 18:11 - +44 7752 359588: Basically more paperwork for the national visa center. This is the stage where I prove we can support Aaron and he won't end up whoring on the streets
19/03/2021, 18:11 - +44 7752 359588: Wait why do you have to make a presentation if you don't give it??
19/03/2021, 18:12 - James Kemp: Jeez way to judge - what if that‚Äôs what Aaron wants to do??
19/03/2021, 18:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Won't end up doing it out of desperation
19/03/2021, 18:12 - Reuben Yarwood: He could still do it for fun though right
19/03/2021, 18:12 - James Kemp: Well I need to have it ready to go in case I somehow didn‚Äôt fluff those tests
19/03/2021, 18:12 - James Kemp: (I love that we are currently having 5 conversations at once)
19/03/2021, 18:21 - +44 7752 359588: Not in Illinois üôÅ
19/03/2021, 18:22 - +44 7752 359588: Ugh godspeed. What are you presenting on
19/03/2021, 18:23 - James Kemp: How I‚Äôd help their HR team run a schools improvement programme - now I‚Äôve spent a few hours on it, I‚Äôm pretty bored
19/03/2021, 18:23 - James Kemp: But maybe it‚Äôd clean my soul not doing pure corporate shit and also getting that public sector work life balance?
19/03/2021, 18:23 - James Kemp: All feels moot at this point anyway so time for a PINT
19/03/2021, 18:24 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
19/03/2021, 18:24 - Sam Lea: Indeed

19/03/2021, 18:32 - James Kemp: I turned on the tv and screamed gay murder
19/03/2021, 18:33 - James Kemp: Also the way I took that pic makes him look like he‚Äôs developing bloaty head syndrome, Theme Hospital styler
19/03/2021, 18:34 - Sam Lea: Yes haha with extremely tiny hands
19/03/2021, 18:34 - James Kemp: Compare the width of the head to the width of the hips!

19/03/2021, 18:37 - James Kemp: As if that pic of her isn‚Äôt even doctored!
19/03/2021, 18:38 - James Kemp: (Well, it‚Äôs slightly doctored - but not as much as you‚Äôd think¬£
19/03/2021, 18:38 - Sam Lea: creasing at the name _*POOT*_
19/03/2021, 18:38 - Sam Lea: whyyy

21/03/2021, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha this is one of my favorite quotes
21/03/2021, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: Think it is originally from 30 Rock?
21/03/2021, 12:01 - +61 474 759 280: Hahaha I assumed it was a Liz original
21/03/2021, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: Oh lord no
21/03/2021, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: But it is one of my life rules

22/03/2021, 10:10 - +61 474 759 280: New South Wales is currently experiencing a spider swarm AND a mouse plague
22/03/2021, 10:10 - +61 474 759 280: What would you prefer?
22/03/2021, 10:11 - +61 474 759 280: I am 100% more comfortable with a spider swarm
22/03/2021, 10:11 - +61 474 759 280: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/22/horrific-swarms-of-spiders-flee-into-homes-and-up-legs-to-escape-nsw-floods

22/03/2021, 10:12 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúLocals who have endured months of mice and rats getting into their houses, stores and cars are praying heavy rain will help wipe them out‚Äù
22/03/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: see, my kneejerk reaction is that i would prefer the mouse plague??
22/03/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: but, even though they scare me less, i wonder if mice would do more damage?
22/03/2021, 10:28 - James Kemp: e.g. gnawing cables
22/03/2021, 10:29 - James Kemp: spiders scare me more, basically
22/03/2021, 10:29 - James Kemp: i 100% know what @447752359588's answer is gonna be...
22/03/2021, 10:30 - +61 474 759 280: I find news of a spider swarm very amusing but if it happened here I *would* have a breakdown
22/03/2021, 10:30 - Reuben Yarwood: No thanks
22/03/2021, 10:31 - James Kemp: i feel like mice actually pose the bigger health/practical danger
22/03/2021, 10:31 - James Kemp: but spiders are just 3 EW 5 ME
22/03/2021, 10:36 - +44 7752 359588: Oh spider swarm for sure
22/03/2021, 10:36 - +44 7752 359588: Any day
22/03/2021, 10:36 - +44 7752 359588: Spiders don't gross me out nearly as much
22/03/2021, 10:36 - +44 7752 359588: I do think mice would be worse from a health and safety perspective
22/03/2021, 10:44 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah nice would do way more damage to property + also spread disease, but spiders also gross me out a lot
22/03/2021, 10:44 - Aaron Ayling: I'd go spiders but I really wouldn't be happy with it
22/03/2021, 12:48 - James Kemp: exit interview 1 done
22/03/2021, 12:48 - James Kemp: i _roasted_ one of the managers
22/03/2021, 12:49 - James Kemp: üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
22/03/2021, 13:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Drag them!
22/03/2021, 13:41 - Aaron Ayling: Hohoho nice - did the interviewers show any discernable reaction? Ie like did you get the impression they already knew all that shit or not?
22/03/2021, 13:41 - James Kemp: i felt like she was gagged when i went in on hannah
22/03/2021, 13:42 - James Kemp: hannah is the director of the strat team - been here a year
22/03/2021, 13:42 - James Kemp: and _wildly_ aggressive with anyone junior to her
22/03/2021, 13:42 - James Kemp: so i spilled that t
22/03/2021, 13:42 - James Kemp: as i feel like she's been getting away with it in part because nobody knows
22/03/2021, 13:44 - James Kemp: also, this is SO GOOD: https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingDerps/comments/mahurr/i_am_spy_dog/
22/03/2021, 13:48 - Aaron Ayling: Haha what a clever dog
22/03/2021, 13:48 - Aaron Ayling: Love this
22/03/2021, 13:49 - James Kemp: the girl i used to manage (before they removed line managers lmaooo) tried to tell her on friday that she's worried about the amount of work coming up in the next two weeks
22/03/2021, 13:49 - James Kemp: the long and short of hannah's response was "why are you worrying about this before it happens? stop overreacting"
22/03/2021, 13:49 - Aaron Ayling: Woooooow
22/03/2021, 13:49 - James Kemp: including a "oh, so shall i just take all your projects on for you? is that what you want?"
22/03/2021, 13:49 - James Kemp: (i told ellie she should've said yes)
22/03/2021, 13:49 - Aaron Ayling: What an idiot cunt
22/03/2021, 13:50 - Aaron Ayling: Haha exactly
22/03/2021, 13:50 - James Kemp: "if that is a genuine question, then yes plz"
22/03/2021, 13:56 - Reuben Yarwood: She actually said this? Jesus
22/03/2021, 13:56 - +44 7752 359588: Yes, read her to filth
22/03/2021, 13:56 - +44 7752 359588: This is all terrible
22/03/2021, 13:56 - Reuben Yarwood: That's just bullying
22/03/2021, 13:56 - James Kemp: yeah and ellie's only 23?
22/03/2021, 13:56 - +44 7752 359588: Except this which is very great
22/03/2021, 13:56 - James Kemp: she said she almost started crying on the call
22/03/2021, 13:57 - James Kemp: it's just fucked up because ellie is raising it with her, because she wants to do good work, and wants the conditions to be right for her to do so, rather than beign so stretched that she can't
22/03/2021, 13:57 - James Kemp: and hannah's response is to treat her like a piece of shit
22/03/2021, 13:57 - James Kemp: anyway, there is the t
22/03/2021, 13:58 - Aaron Ayling: ^ you tell this story to the exit interviewer btw?
22/03/2021, 13:58 - Aaron Ayling: or was it more general
22/03/2021, 14:00 - James Kemp: no, i gave her all the detail and specifics
22/03/2021, 14:00 - Aaron Ayling: fucking love it

26/03/2021, 10:47 - James Kemp: not sure if it means i managed to successfully google my way through those horrendous assessments?
26/03/2021, 10:48 - James Kemp: either way, there's something quite good about being in a pre-interview headspace of "not really fussed about this role" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

26/03/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: @447752359588 don't think this will quite get you to dolly rockers level of euphoria, but i could see you enjoying its trash nonetheless
26/03/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: "you make me want to jump-jump out the window" is a pretty sik chorus line
26/03/2021, 11:40 - James Kemp: this one features my favourite nadiah oh line: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M0oaqR60wg

26/03/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha this is great
26/03/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: Personally the line: the girls call me london, cos I am based in London
26/03/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: That really did it for me
26/03/2021, 15:34 - +44 7752 359588: As did her deadpan "bitch"
26/03/2021, 15:34 - James Kemp: This line is üíØ

26/03/2021, 19:28 - James Kemp: i'm not sure it's going to be a yes, but i think i did myself proud!
26/03/2021, 19:28 - James Kemp: i think i passed the test of "would we want to work with jim?", but could see them having questions over "does jim have all the technical skills we need for the role?"
26/03/2021, 19:28 - James Kemp: so it depends on how much they want an already finished package vs. a fun bitch who's down to learn fast ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
26/03/2021, 19:29 - James Kemp: (hopefully any finished packages they did interview were boring af)
26/03/2021, 19:33 - Sam Lea: Well, fingers thoroughly crossed - how would you feel about it as a potential place, if you were to get it? What was The Vibe there
26/03/2021, 19:33 - James Kemp: i think i would take it, purely because of the circumstances right now
26/03/2021, 19:33 - Sam Lea: and crucially, how close to *Abbott* could one conceivably get
26/03/2021, 19:33 - James Kemp: pay, location, it being a fixed term contract were all toots

30/03/2021, 18:11 - James Kemp: i'm gonna take that 5 day cash for a while, i reckon

30/03/2021, 23:56 - +61 474 759 280: They‚Äôve got a real complex about it in WA
31/03/2021, 00:00 - James Kemp: You gotta grow one now, mate
31/03/2021, 00:00 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs a political statement and you‚Äôre the man to make it
31/03/2021, 00:01 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôd be Joe Dirt
31/03/2021, 00:01 - James Kemp: Daddy Dirt
31/03/2021, 00:01 - James Kemp: A new Stowellman era
31/03/2021, 00:01 - +61 474 759 280: Give me license to rock more bolo ties
31/03/2021, 06:01 - +61 474 759 280: Spent this morning trawling through an elderly Jewish woman‚Äôs flat for free stuff for when I move
31/03/2021, 06:02 - +61 474 759 280: She‚Äôs in the local labour branch and heard I was moving so offered me a fridge and a washing machine
31/03/2021, 06:02 - +61 474 759 280: Check out her place:

31/03/2021, 06:03 - +61 474 759 280: Different wallpaper in every room
31/03/2021, 06:03 - +61 474 759 280: Bed was very Austin Powers
31/03/2021, 07:50 - +61 474 759 280: My dad also finally spoke to my grandfather about being adopted and how he has five living brothers
31/03/2021, 07:51 - +61 474 759 280: Direct quote: ‚ÄúAfter 80 years, the truth has finally come out‚Äù
31/03/2021, 07:53 - +61 474 759 280: Apparently he discovered he was adopted on his own trying to enrol in a footy team when he was a teenager because he needed his birth certificate. Once he saw he had a different name he kept it to himself *for his entire life*
31/03/2021, 09:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Woooowww
31/03/2021, 09:09 - Reuben Yarwood: This was from your granddad?
31/03/2021, 09:09 - +61 474 759 280: Yep
31/03/2021, 09:10 - +61 474 759 280: From aged 13 to 93
31/03/2021, 09:11 - Reuben Yarwood: Hold on, your grandad wasn't 13 when he adopted though surely?
31/03/2021, 09:11 - +61 474 759 280: Nope when he found out
31/03/2021, 09:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow can't imagine keeping that quiet at that age. What a burden
31/03/2021, 09:12 - +61 474 759 280: Never even told his wife
31/03/2021, 09:12 - +61 474 759 280: Really sad
31/03/2021, 09:12 - +61 474 759 280: He‚Äôs up for meeting his five living brothers, which is going to be nuts
31/03/2021, 09:13 - Aaron Ayling: Oh wow yeah I don't think I could just keep that quiet
31/03/2021, 09:13 - Reuben Yarwood: He's never met them!?
31/03/2021, 09:13 - Aaron Ayling: Your Dad thought he didn't know, right?
31/03/2021, 09:13 - Aaron Ayling: Did he know he had bio brothers?
31/03/2021, 09:13 - +61 474 759 280: Wasn‚Äôt certain
31/03/2021, 09:13 - +61 474 759 280: No!
31/03/2021, 09:14 - +61 474 759 280: Just learnt of their existence today
31/03/2021, 09:14 - Aaron Ayling: Wow
31/03/2021, 09:14 - Aaron Ayling: The media would love that as a local news story
31/03/2021, 09:14 - Aaron Ayling: 93 year old man meets his biological siblings for the first time
31/03/2021, 09:15 - Aaron Ayling: Clickbaity as FUCK
31/03/2021, 09:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Does your dad know who the biological siblings are? Like has he looked them up?
31/03/2021, 09:16 - +61 474 759 280: We met one of them last month, they live out of town
31/03/2021, 09:16 - +61 474 759 280: In a place called Ballarat
31/03/2021, 09:17 - +61 474 759 280: We lived there for a couple of years when I was a wee lad
31/03/2021, 09:17 - +61 474 759 280: Aka The Rat
31/03/2021, 09:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Can you see the resemblance?
31/03/2021, 09:18 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah definitely can lol
31/03/2021, 09:18 - Sam Lea: And when were his five bros made aware that they actually had a sixth
31/03/2021, 09:18 - +61 474 759 280: About a month ago
31/03/2021, 09:18 - +61 474 759 280: They had an argument about it because the younger ones assumed the eldest must have known (he didn‚Äôt though)
31/03/2021, 09:19 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 09:20 - +61 474 759 280: Hah!
31/03/2021, 09:20 - Aaron Ayling: Ooh that's rough
31/03/2021, 09:21 - Reuben Yarwood: So your grandad was the first child, which the parents couldn't deal with at the time?
31/03/2021, 09:22 - +61 474 759 280: Nope, grandma had him pre-marriage with some dude, we don‚Äôt know who that is
31/03/2021, 09:23 - +61 474 759 280: There are like three options but it‚Äôs a tough one to crack. Think dad‚Äôs made it his life mission to solve it now
31/03/2021, 09:23 - +61 474 759 280: The five sons all come from the same dad, who came along after my grandfather was born and given up
31/03/2021, 09:25 - +61 474 759 280: Crazy days
31/03/2021, 09:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow that's wild
31/03/2021, 09:28 - Reuben Yarwood: We're they Catholic? Such toxic attitudes back then with sex before marriage and all that
31/03/2021, 09:28 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah that‚Äôs exactly it
31/03/2021, 09:28 - +61 474 759 280: Really sad situation
31/03/2021, 09:28 - Reuben Yarwood: And obviously no condoms
31/03/2021, 09:29 - Reuben Yarwood: How's your grandad doing today?
31/03/2021, 09:29 - +61 474 759 280: He took it exceptionally well
31/03/2021, 09:30 - +61 474 759 280: Sort of at that age where he doesn‚Äôt really get angry about anything now
31/03/2021, 09:30 - Aaron Ayling: A shame it wasnt a couple of decades back and you could have had an irl mamma Mia
31/03/2021, 09:30 - +61 474 759 280: By the sounds of it is keen to air it out
31/03/2021, 09:30 - Aaron Ayling: Thnisnis great to hear
31/03/2021, 09:31 - Aaron Ayling: Can imagine it being so perspective shifting
31/03/2021, 09:31 - +61 474 759 280: Dad also said he couldn‚Äôt have had this conversation with him ten years ago, he would‚Äôve been too defensive/agitated
31/03/2021, 09:31 - Aaron Ayling: Right right
31/03/2021, 09:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah bless him.
31/03/2021, 09:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Good to hear he's at peace with it all
31/03/2021, 09:32 - Sam Lea: I suppose the most you can do is be philosophical about it... The one good thing, at least, is they'll get to meet where they might never have done so at all.
31/03/2021, 09:33 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah totally
31/03/2021, 09:34 - +61 474 759 280: I do wonder if life for him these days is just one big fever dream
31/03/2021, 09:34 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got five brothers? Sure, if you say so‚Äù
31/03/2021, 09:40 - Reuben Yarwood: Does your grandad have siblings in his adoptive family?
31/03/2021, 09:41 - +61 474 759 280: Yep they‚Äôre mostly deceased now
31/03/2021, 09:45 - Reuben Yarwood: It's cool that he had that growing up
31/03/2021, 09:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Although must have been weird to know he wasn't their biological brother the whole time
31/03/2021, 09:46 - +61 474 759 280: I think they were all mostly adopted too
31/03/2021, 09:46 - +44 7752 359588: This whole story is such a damn wild ride
31/03/2021, 09:46 - +44 7752 359588: The twist that your grandpa already knew as well!!!
31/03/2021, 09:47 - +44 7752 359588: My grandfather was also adopted, but everyone knew
31/03/2021, 09:47 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently he was almost getting too friendly with what turned out to be his half sister tho - someone in the neighborhood had to warn him off
31/03/2021, 09:57 - Sam Lea: Wow... Proper Luke and Leia moment
31/03/2021, 11:13 - Aaron Ayling: So I just found out that Armie Hammer's great grandad owned Arm and Hammer
31/03/2021, 11:13 - Aaron Ayling: It's a big day for revelations
31/03/2021, 11:14 - Sam Lea: No
31/03/2021, 11:15 - Aaron Ayling: Yep - his great grandad was a super rich businessman called Armand Hammer
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh have you read that Vanity Fair article? I had a proper deep dive into that the other day
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Reuben Yarwood: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/03/the-fall-of-armie-hammer-a-family-saga-of-sex-money-drugs-and-betrayal
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Reuben Yarwood: His family sounds wild
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Sam Lea: "However, the Arm & Hammer company's brand name did not originate with Armand Hammer. It was in use 31 years before Hammer was born.[35] "
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Sam Lea: But still, talk about nominative determinism
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Aaron Ayling: BUT he didn't actually start Arm and Hammer - he just bought it coz he was sick of everyone going "hey Armand Hammer - do you own Arm & Hammer?"
31/03/2021, 11:16 - Sam Lea: How crazy is that
31/03/2021, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Imagine being that rich
31/03/2021, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: I just buy the rights to the Reuben Sandwich
31/03/2021, 11:17 - Sam Lea: just to stop people _banging on_ about it, sheesh
31/03/2021, 11:18 - Sam Lea: Such a charmed life üòÖ
31/03/2021, 11:18 - +44 7752 359588: Such a great rich person move
31/03/2021, 11:18 - +61 474 759 280: Batman villain-esque
31/03/2021, 12:13 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 12:13 - +61 474 759 280: Can‚Äôt help themselves
31/03/2021, 12:14 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 12:14 - James Kemp: 99 messages imma need a tldr
31/03/2021, 12:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Was the "with your mouth" really necessary
31/03/2021, 12:19 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: Johnny's grandad revealed he knew he was adopted just didn't tell anyone and Armie Hammer's great grandad owned Arm & Hammer
31/03/2021, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: Grandad chat
31/03/2021, 12:29 - James Kemp: Oh damn I missed a lot
31/03/2021, 12:29 - James Kemp: What a ride
31/03/2021, 12:29 - +44 7752 359588: I think the real armie hammer highlight was that the great grandad was named Armand Hammer and bought Arm And Hammer just so people would stop asking him if he owned it
31/03/2021, 12:30 - +44 7752 359588: So he didn't name it, the name already existed
31/03/2021, 12:31 - +44 7752 359588: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56585538
31/03/2021, 12:31 - +44 7752 359588: Also this headline keeps making me lol

31/03/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: Yes this is the meme we need
31/03/2021, 12:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Ah cool cool, problem solved
31/03/2021, 12:39 - Reuben Yarwood: We just weren't doing the right research!
31/03/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: Actually, everything‚Äôs _great_
31/03/2021, 12:43 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha, same. Wow feel like I missed a season.
31/03/2021, 14:20 - Aaron Ayling: Also re: playing some ganes/whatever for Liz's bday the new among us map is put today
31/03/2021, 14:29 - James Kemp: Oooh!!
31/03/2021, 14:29 - James Kemp: Did we pin down the date?
31/03/2021, 14:29 - James Kemp: No I don‚Äôt think we did coz nobody else replied?
31/03/2021, 14:29 - James Kemp: üëÅ
31/03/2021, 14:30 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 14:30 - +61 474 759 280: What time are you thinking @447752359588
31/03/2021, 14:31 - +61 474 759 280: I might be able to do Saturday
31/03/2021, 14:31 - +61 474 759 280: But probably not Friday
31/03/2021, 14:32 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha
31/03/2021, 14:32 - +44 7752 359588: I'm flexible on times
31/03/2021, 14:32 - +44 7752 359588: Was thinking 8pm?
31/03/2021, 14:32 - +44 7752 359588: Could bump to 7?
31/03/2021, 14:33 - +61 474 759 280: Lol well 7pm would be 5am here, 8pm would be a lot better
31/03/2021, 14:33 - +44 7462 872590: I'm in! What day did y'all decide?
31/03/2021, 14:38 - +44 7752 359588: Ahhh
31/03/2021, 14:38 - +44 7752 359588: Well let's say 8:30pm Saturday then?
31/03/2021, 14:38 - +61 474 759 280: üòé
31/03/2021, 14:38 - +44 7752 359588: And johnny swing in if you fancy but no need to get up at the ass crack of dawn either
31/03/2021, 14:39 - +44 7752 359588: I expect we'll go at least a few hours?
31/03/2021, 14:40 - +61 474 759 280: Haha thanks I‚Äôll see how I go ‚úåÔ∏è
31/03/2021, 15:02 - +44 7462 872590: ü•≥
31/03/2021, 16:20 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
31/03/2021, 16:21 - James Kemp: Wait what?!
31/03/2021, 16:22 - James Kemp: This exceptional customer service was for weed?!
31/03/2021, 16:22 - +44 7752 359588: These names üòÇ
31/03/2021, 16:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah! Well, seeds
31/03/2021, 16:25 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs amazing
31/03/2021, 16:26 - James Kemp: Do you know what they are? Indica/sativa/etc.?
31/03/2021, 16:26 - Reuben Yarwood: Mixture I think. I asked for low thc/high cbd/good for pain relief. It's more for my mum tbh
31/03/2021, 16:58 - Aaron Ayling: That's super cool! You should be able to get more out of the adult plant too eh?
31/03/2021, 19:29 - Sam Lea: What sort of heat / light do they need?
31/03/2021, 19:49 - Reuben Yarwood: As in more seeds? I don't think so as they're feminised seeds (the only ones that produce THC) and I guess to produce seeds you need to get the male plant involved?
31/03/2021, 19:51 - Reuben Yarwood: I think they're all different. Some varieties are much easier to cultivate. Our greenhouse though is really hot and bright and humid so I think they'll like it
31/03/2021, 19:58 - Aaron Ayling: Nah I mean cultivating from a cutting which I thiiiink is possible?
31/03/2021, 20:14 - Reuben Yarwood: I have no idea!
31/03/2021, 20:15 - James Kemp: This is like on bake off when they complain about making custard when you can just buy shop bought
31/03/2021, 20:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Just reading about it now. They're annuals so only last one season, but you can take cuttings and propagate that way üëçüèª

07/04/2021, 08:45 - +61 474 759 280: Is Stoke on Trent in the north or the midlands?
07/04/2021, 08:45 - Aaron Ayling: Horrifying
07/04/2021, 08:46 - Aaron Ayling: I'd say it's just on thr cusp of the North? But
07/04/2021, 08:46 - +61 474 759 280: But
07/04/2021, 08:46 - Aaron Ayling: But I don't know what it's actually classified as. I feel the Stoke accent is kind of a generic "Northern" one though
07/04/2021, 08:47 - Aaron Ayling: And I think Sam has said it is midlands in the past
07/04/2021, 08:48 - +61 474 759 280: Line-ball decision
07/04/2021, 09:02 - +61 474 759 280: Liz/Aaron have you been following the Matt Gaetz saga

07/04/2021, 09:14 - Aaron Ayling: Only very briefly via reddit headlines
07/04/2021, 09:15 - Aaron Ayling: But this is a cool fact!
07/04/2021, 09:17 - Sam Lea: Categorically Midlands
07/04/2021, 09:17 - Sam Lea: And I guess I'm disappointed to say I've spent enough time in and around Stoke On Trent to be aware it's quite a distinct accent
07/04/2021, 09:19 - Aaron Ayling: Oh yeah it's definitely its own accent! I just mean I don't know it well enough and thus I would (perhaps incorrectly) lump it as "Northern" due to my own ignorance
07/04/2021, 17:17 - James Kemp: had to go into my old work inbox to retrieve something, and spied this email from a client
07/04/2021, 17:17 - James Kemp: ""Hi Becky,

We are sorry to hear Jim has left Given, as he was from our perspective 50 percent of the success in working with you. We felt you really brought complementary skills, styles and personalities to the table that worked well together for us last year."
07/04/2021, 17:17 - James Kemp: this feels so shady it gives me *life*?!
07/04/2021, 17:17 - James Kemp: like kind of suggesting that becky's personality alone is a bit shit?
07/04/2021, 17:22 - Reuben Yarwood: We're you and Becky 50/50 in terms of the work on the project?
07/04/2021, 17:24 - James Kemp: Nah it was like 90/10 me/her
07/04/2021, 17:24 - James Kemp: Becky‚Äôs the founder, kinda sucks
07/04/2021, 17:25 - James Kemp: So any shade towards her gets a huge TOOT from me
07/04/2021, 17:31 - Reuben Yarwood: It is hard to read that any way!
07/04/2021, 17:31 - Reuben Yarwood: *any other way
07/04/2021, 17:35 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs also just so unnecessary - like it just doesn‚Äôt need to be said

09/04/2021, 13:55 - Aaron Ayling: Maybe they killed him to distract From NI?
09/04/2021, 13:55 - Aaron Ayling: But they almost certainly gave media outlets a decent amount of heads up before announcing it
09/04/2021, 13:56 - Aaron Ayling: But I doubt more that 24 hours
09/04/2021, 13:59 - Edward Beesley: I had a patient who works at Bloomberg who came in one day saying he'd had a really busy week because they'd been prepping for his death

17/04/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh have you tried out the at home covid tests yet
17/04/2021, 12:46 - James Kemp: Yep, we are two negative queens!!
17/04/2021, 12:47 - James Kemp: The tests are gross tho - tickling yo tonsils and shoving it up yo nose üôà
17/04/2021, 12:48 - James Kemp: Vicky Park maybe followed by some People‚Äôs Park Tavern if it doesn‚Äôt seem too hellish (hoping table service will sort it out but let‚Äôs see)
17/04/2021, 12:52 - Reuben Yarwood: sounds ace
17/04/2021, 12:52 - Reuben Yarwood: it's going to be absolutely slammed! Great pub though
17/04/2021, 12:54 - James Kemp: Yeah that‚Äôs my fear...
17/04/2021, 12:54 - James Kemp: May just default back to park if it‚Äôs too much tbh
17/04/2021, 13:25 - +44 7752 359588: Which do you prefer - nose or throat? I'm nervous to try haha
17/04/2021, 13:29 - Reuben Yarwood: I did one a few months ago and nose is deffo the worst bit
17/04/2021, 13:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Not too bad though,
17/04/2021, 13:29 - +61 474 759 280: Nose is awful
17/04/2021, 13:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Lot of sneezing
17/04/2021, 13:30 - James Kemp: This test makes you do both!
17/04/2021, 13:31 - James Kemp: Throat first, then same swab up nose
17/04/2021, 13:31 - +44 7752 359588: Ahhhh I didn't realize you had to do both
17/04/2021, 13:31 - +44 7752 359588: Man I am a gaggy bitch tho

17/04/2021, 19:28 - +44 7752 359588: You get in to the pub?
17/04/2021, 19:28 - James Kemp: Popped into a tiny lil Italian craft bar?!
17/04/2021, 19:29 - James Kemp: I love how all the bars that would usually be wholly inside seating are forcing outside seating on their gig
17/04/2021, 19:30 - James Kemp: Walked past a fucking pie shop that was HEAVING with outdoor pinters
17/04/2021, 19:31 - +44 7752 359588: Looool
17/04/2021, 19:31 - James Kemp: It felt fucking great ngl

17/04/2021, 22:44 - +44 7752 359588: If this wasn't america, I don't know what was
17/04/2021, 22:44 - +44 7752 359588: I have no recollection of getting these, but my dad has held onto them for 20 years, so
17/04/2021, 23:12 - +61 474 759 280: The original NFTs
17/04/2021, 23:17 - Sam Lea: "Libearty" üòç

18/04/2021, 17:45 - +44 7462 872590: üòç
19/04/2021, 18:14 - Aaron Ayling: Can the football people explain the football thing and why it's bad plz
19/04/2021, 18:14 - James Kemp: plot twist - i think i can?!
19/04/2021, 18:14 - James Kemp: basically, they wanna create a closed league of the top 20 clubs
19/04/2021, 18:15 - James Kemp: no relegations
19/04/2021, 18:15 - +44 7752 359588: This is the gag of the century
19/04/2021, 18:15 - James Kemp: because stability in business = more profit
19/04/2021, 18:15 - James Kemp: whereas, if you're relegated, your business value can really drastically change between seasons (from ¬£70m to ¬£170m)
19/04/2021, 18:16 - James Kemp: so basically all the investors (a lot of them american, who want to emulate american football leagues) are chasing that stable cash
19/04/2021, 18:16 - +44 7752 359588: And a few teams are relegated every season no matter what? Is it just the ones with the worst record?
19/04/2021, 18:16 - James Kemp: in the regular league, yes
19/04/2021, 18:16 - James Kemp: but not in this super league
19/04/2021, 18:16 - +44 7752 359588: And relegation just means they drop down a tier or something?
19/04/2021, 18:16 - James Kemp: it'd be a closed shop of the top 20 clubs?
19/04/2021, 18:16 - James Kemp: (may need a football head to iron out the details, but that's the principle)
19/04/2021, 18:16 - James Kemp: yeah, they go down to a lower league
19/04/2021, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: Is this not shady because the top 20 presumably change sometimes?
19/04/2021, 18:17 - James Kemp: but obviously for fans, the instability is what makes it a fucking sport
19/04/2021, 18:17 - James Kemp: the rise and the fall
19/04/2021, 18:17 - James Kemp: the prospect, like leciester, of becoming a big fucking deal in the space of a decade
19/04/2021, 18:17 - James Kemp: the ability to do that would be eradicated in this league
19/04/2021, 18:17 - James Kemp: because there'd be no rise and fall
19/04/2021, 18:17 - +44 7752 359588: So like a normally shit team having a good few years would suddenly be in this closed league?
19/04/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: just different rankings within the same league amongst the same teams
19/04/2021, 18:18 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah feels like it kills the drama
19/04/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: well, normally shit teams wouldn't even be invited
19/04/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: only the 'elite' teams
19/04/2021, 18:18 - +44 7752 359588: But who decides who's elite???
19/04/2021, 18:18 - +44 7752 359588: I know nothing about football
19/04/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: the teams themselves!
19/04/2021, 18:18 - James Kemp: they've clubbed together
19/04/2021, 18:19 - +44 7752 359588: Ahh this makes it even funnier to me
19/04/2021, 18:19 - +44 7752 359588: Also jim, I am so very impressed right now
19/04/2021, 18:19 - James Kemp: apparently covid has fucked their income, so it's literally a pure business decision
19/04/2021, 18:19 - James Kemp: to make their business value more stable
19/04/2021, 18:20 - James Kemp: i was interested, so i went reading
19/04/2021, 18:20 - James Kemp: but now, like uefa are biting back
19/04/2021, 18:20 - James Kemp: and saying any teams who sign up to this league
19/04/2021, 18:20 - +44 7752 359588: It is a surprisingly interesting story, given that it's about football
19/04/2021, 18:20 - James Kemp: WILL HAVE THEIR PLAYERS BANNED FROM THE WORLD CUP
19/04/2021, 18:20 - +44 7752 359588: AHHHH
19/04/2021, 18:20 - +44 7752 359588: At least someone's bringing the drama
19/04/2021, 18:20 - James Kemp: and obviously fans are fucking hating it, because - as i said - it removes the rise and fall, aka the fact that this is a sport
19/04/2021, 18:22 - +44 7752 359588: It does seem like a bad long-term idea
19/04/2021, 18:22 - James Kemp: my undersatnding is it's literally a league of the same 20 teams, no relegations or promotions, just playing each other year on year on year
19/04/2021, 18:22 - James Kemp: it's a terrible idea for the sport; potentially (and this is why they're doing it) good for business - but that business case will presumably go out the window if everyone boycotts the games
19/04/2021, 18:23 - +44 7752 359588: Exactly
19/04/2021, 18:23 - James Kemp: and that is the extent of my understanding
19/04/2021, 18:23 - +44 7752 359588: It seems like it would get boring after a while, but hey sports are already sometimes boring to me so what do I know
19/04/2021, 18:24 - James Kemp: apparently tehy're trying to emulate some american sports model?
19/04/2021, 18:24 - James Kemp: not sure if it was the nfl or something idk
19/04/2021, 18:25 - James Kemp: it does basically seem like it's just capitalism ruining football
19/04/2021, 18:29 - +44 7462 872590: Essentially the richest 15 clubs (not currently the best 15 clubs) would form this Super League and invite 5 other clubs to join. Creating an NFL style competition. Effectively ending the Premier League as we know it and preventing any other club from reaching their level. Could have wider ramifications as players in these top clubs may be banned from playing for their country. So no Harry Kane for England ect.
19/04/2021, 18:30 - +44 7462 872590: The owners of the club's are also incharge of the Super League... So they make all the decision.
19/04/2021, 18:31 - +44 7462 872590: Pretty much, has been that way for years, but now they are properly taking control. Not pretending to care about anyone else.
19/04/2021, 18:32 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ
19/04/2021, 18:32 - James Kemp: George all I want is for you to tell me you‚Äôre proud of me that I got like 80% of that?
19/04/2021, 18:32 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
19/04/2021, 18:32 - James Kemp: ü•∫
19/04/2021, 18:32 - +44 7462 872590: 90% I'd say!
19/04/2021, 18:32 - James Kemp: ü•≥
19/04/2021, 18:37 - +44 7462 872590: This has been on the cards for years. Everyone wants a billionaire to take over their football club and buy the best players. Now they're acting just like a billionaire football club owner everyone is upset. Be careful what you wish for I guess.
19/04/2021, 18:39 - James Kemp: Also Liz, Gary Lineker is NOT happy
19/04/2021, 18:39 - James Kemp: So that‚Äôs a useful yardstick to know it‚Äôs probably bad
19/04/2021, 18:39 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha Daddy Gary is not a happy bunny
19/04/2021, 18:39 - Sam Lea: The part that smarts the most for me is, if a team like Man U or Liverpool are booted from the Premier League and the Champions League, and don't continue to play in them, not only does it significantly alter the nature of those leagues forever, it renders all those teams' achievements in those leagues effectively irrelevant overnight
19/04/2021, 18:39 - James Kemp: The lefty luvvy hates it!!
19/04/2021, 18:40 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah definitely
19/04/2021, 18:40 - Sam Lea: Yeah, pleased at least the punditry seems unanimously aligned against it
19/04/2021, 18:51 - +44 7752 359588: This is an excellent yardstick
19/04/2021, 18:52 - Aaron Ayling: I'm turned on ngl
19/04/2021, 18:57 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah sounds a lot like the NFL model eh
19/04/2021, 20:00 - Edward Beesley: How likely is it to happen, considering that almost everyone is against it?
19/04/2021, 20:00 - Edward Beesley: Would be quite fun if they went ahead with it, and everyone successfully boycotted it so they all went bust and had to work their way up to the prem from the Conference North Division

19/04/2021, 20:03 - +61 474 759 280: Do you think Boris had two tweets prepared. One supporting it. One against. And he put out the against one once he saw everyone was furious.

20/04/2021, 12:23 - Reuben Yarwood: What's the craic, is everyone still free?
20/04/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: Am still free but hadn‚Äôt heard anything, so presumed it wasn‚Äôt going ahead?!
20/04/2021, 12:29 - +44 7752 359588: Oh yes I was supposed to do the selection but never got around to it because I am the worst and got distracted
20/04/2021, 12:29 - +44 7752 359588: If there is a strong appetite for it, we could always reschedule and I could get my life together?
20/04/2021, 12:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Personally, keen
20/04/2021, 12:31 - James Kemp: Would also be down!

20/04/2021, 14:02 - +44 7752 359588: Please tell me everything you buy so I can live vicariously
20/04/2021, 14:04 - +44 7752 359588: Re: eurovision - definitely down to try to get it together. I have no plans ever, so can do whenever, but how about May 8?
20/04/2021, 14:04 - +44 7752 359588: If I get selections sorted this week, that gives about 2 weeks
20/04/2021, 14:04 - +44 7752 359588: And it is then 2 weeks from then to real eurovisio
20/04/2021, 14:16 - Reuben Yarwood: This sounds so fun!

20/04/2021, 19:03 - +44 7752 359588: Not right in our building, but like 2 blocks away?

A) I'm an arsehole

21/04/2021, 15:03 - Edward Beesley: Jokes on me for canceling, I guess
21/04/2021, 15:03 - Aaron Ayling: "I wish to cancel this subscription"

27/04/2021, 20:15 - +44 7752 359588: I also have a back up list of countries
27/04/2021, 20:15 - James Kemp: I mean, I would be down for double entry but happy either way!

27/04/2021, 20:17 - +44 7752 359588: This will not be as high production value as it was when Jim ran it, but will put something together. Really regretting that we got rid of the Graham Norton mask

28/04/2021, 11:29 - +44 7752 359588: Although obviously no one would blame you if you couldn't resist the siren song of Daz Sampson
28/04/2021, 11:37 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm trying to resist but it's so hard
28/04/2021, 11:54 - Sam Lea: Meanwhile, in Italy...

28/04/2021, 14:02 - +44 7752 359588: Think I gave myself 15 seconds plus a chorus of each song initially and then listened to the whole thing if it sounded good
28/04/2021, 14:16 - Sam Lea: Oooph, poisoned chalice getting Italy - didn't know they didn't compete between 1997 and 2011??

28/04/2021, 14:17 - +44 7752 359588: They've been very highly rated in recent years
28/04/2021, 14:17 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah Malta didn't compete in the 80s... So not hair metal from Malta  unfortunately.
28/04/2021, 14:20 - +44 7462 872590: Facing the ultimate Eurovision choice... pure comedy act or good serious song.
28/04/2021, 14:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Any idea why?
28/04/2021, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: The struggle

29/04/2021, 10:07 - +44 7752 359588: Or alternately I've been listening to a lot of Kate Bush recently?
29/04/2021, 10:09 - James Kemp: Insta is a CREEP
29/04/2021, 12:36 - +44 7752 359588: I'm all for politicians not receiving special favors, etc, but does anyone else find it sort of ridiculous that Matt Hancock didn't get a vaccine before his age group was eligible? Like George got vaccinated before the Health Secretary???
29/04/2021, 12:39 - +44 7462 872590: I sorted out the leopard skin rugs for Boris's flat so got bumped up the list.
29/04/2021, 12:39 - +44 7462 872590: Democracy
29/04/2021, 12:39 - +44 7752 359588: Ah I always knew you were a man of taste

29/04/2021, 12:40 - +44 7462 872590: But yeah, surly Hancock is a key worker who should get the jab earl.
29/04/2021, 12:40 - +44 7462 872590: It's almost like they don't know what they're doing
29/04/2021, 12:42 - +44 7462 872590: Also I bet all the Tories refer to him by his last name only, just so they can say cock. Matt plays along but it hurts him deep down.
29/04/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: Hamcock
29/04/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: A delightful image
29/04/2021, 12:45 - +44 7752 359588: Is that not what they all call Cameron?
29/04/2021, 12:45 - +61 474 759 280: Nice ü§å

30/04/2021, 09:46 - Aaron Ayling: I don't think Enya is necessarily a road trip song. Althoooough the Lord of the Rings Soundtrack which she is on was very lovely to drive through Scotland to with Ed
30/04/2021, 09:55 - James Kemp: I will pass this feedback on
30/04/2021, 09:55 - +44 7752 359588: I think with the right landscape an enya album could be great!

30/04/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: it came on when we were ducked up at burn in Canada and none of us quite knew what was happening
30/04/2021, 09:58 - +61 474 759 280: One Week - Bare Naked Ladies

30/04/2021, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: Like most die antwoord songs I can never tell if I like it or hate it
30/04/2021, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: They sort of creep me out
30/04/2021, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: Very skaggy
30/04/2021, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: BANGER

30/04/2021, 10:03 - +44 7752 359588: It was a weird vibe
30/04/2021, 10:03 - +44 7752 359588: Although to be fair it was a Halloween party
30/04/2021, 10:04 - James Kemp: I Fink U Freeky is a classic

30/04/2021, 10:25 - Sam Lea: Reuben I have a very strong association of going up to Edinburgh for NYE 2010 with Death Cab's The New Year... Can't tell if I've invented a memory of driving up there, using the memory of driving up to Glasgow to see Blink 182
30/04/2021, 10:25 - Edward Beesley: Now Jim has temporary care of a cat called George...

30/04/2021, 10:33 - +44 7752 359588: Jim the iguana?

04/05/2021, 09:34 - +61 474 759 280: I thought that but he‚Äôs engaged twink mode now
04/05/2021, 09:34 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
04/05/2021, 09:34 - +61 474 759 280: So cool

04/05/2021, 09:48 - Aaron Ayling: Glad to hear kayaking went well! Did you try the quad bikes?
04/05/2021, 10:03 - James Kemp: Thankfully the quad bike was only for transporting luggage!

04/05/2021, 10:03 - James Kemp: Surrounded by seals as we did it though!
04/05/2021, 10:03 - Aaron Ayling: That's so cool!
04/05/2021, 10:04 - James Kemp: Kept bobbing up to say hey and then diving down again

04/05/2021, 10:05 - +44 7752 359588: I hope frisby got some pics of them!

05/05/2021, 14:07 - James Kemp: How‚Äôs everyone getting on with their Eurovision choices?!
05/05/2021, 14:08 - James Kemp: Also, showering yday, found two ticks on my arm (!!!). Frisby managed to tweeze them out - seems like we got them early and fully (and apparently risk from
UK ticks is tiny) so should be fine but EWWWWW
05/05/2021, 14:12 - +44 7752 359588: Yes, meant to remind people - need them by EOD Friday, especially as I am now working an event during the day sat
05/05/2021, 14:12 - +44 7752 359588: Big up to reuben for having already submitted

05/05/2021, 14:13 - +44 7752 359588: I did have to burn a tick off my dad's face once
05/05/2021, 14:13 - +44 7752 359588: What horror
05/05/2021, 14:13 - James Kemp: Omfg
05/05/2021, 14:13 - +44 7752 359588: That's one of the other ways to get them off ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
05/05/2021, 14:13 - James Kemp: Sooooooo grim
05/05/2021, 14:14 - +44 7752 359588: Well at least if you get lyme disease you're one step closer to becoming avril lavigne
05/05/2021, 14:14 - James Kemp: If I start releasing trashy Japanglish music, you‚Äôll know they got me gal

06/05/2021, 10:27 - Sam Lea: Ticketline worked for me
06/05/2021, 10:27 - Sam Lea: Hard to say, I guess...
06/05/2021, 10:27 - Sam Lea: Presumably they'll either refund or roll-over to next year
07/05/2021, 03:51 - +61 474 759 280: The Cock Destroyers have broken up?????
07/05/2021, 03:52 - +61 474 759 280: What‚Äôs the word on the ground people?
07/05/2021, 10:34 - Reuben Yarwood: Looking to get my mum some sandals for her birthday
07/05/2021, 10:34 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
07/05/2021, 10:34 - Reuben Yarwood: Do you think Birkenstocks lean into the lesbian thing?
07/05/2021, 10:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Why else would you call a shoe "Glenda"?
07/05/2021, 10:35 - Reuben Yarwood: SAD!
07/05/2021, 10:35 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah I‚Äôm working through their greatest hits tonight
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: I mean sort of but also I love them
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: They are great shoes
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: Very comfortable
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: And arguably trendy with hipsters these days
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +61 474 759 280: Glenn, my friend who you met, loves his Birkenstocks
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: How many hits do they even have?
07/05/2021, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: A man of taste
07/05/2021, 10:41 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm talking about porn
07/05/2021, 10:41 - +44 7752 359588: How big are Birkenstocks in Australia? They seem like they would fit my imagined vibe of life down under
07/05/2021, 10:41 - +61 474 759 280: Huge
07/05/2021, 10:42 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha nvm - did they ever do songs? Have I just gotten confused?
07/05/2021, 10:42 - +61 474 759 280: I don‚Äôt think they did no
07/05/2021, 10:43 - +61 474 759 280: They DJ‚Äôd at G-A-Y for a while
07/05/2021, 10:43 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs as close as they got to a music career I think
07/05/2021, 10:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Felix loves his
07/05/2021, 10:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Pretty sure he's worn them to Berghain
07/05/2021, 10:45 - +44 7752 359588: Does he get read to filth by the Germans? My Birkenstocks were constantly made fun of in Hamburg
07/05/2021, 10:45 - +44 7752 359588: They consider them to be garden shoes and think it's hilarious to see someone wearing them out
07/05/2021, 10:45 - Reuben Yarwood: I think this is a Hamburg vs Berlin thing, I can see them going down well in Berlin
07/05/2021, 10:45 - +44 7752 359588: Although maybe 7 years later they're trendy again
07/05/2021, 10:45 - +44 7752 359588: Also legit
07/05/2021, 10:45 - Reuben Yarwood: But don't most Germans think Berliners are arse holes?
07/05/2021, 10:47 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
07/05/2021, 10:48 - +44 7752 359588: I mean probs
07/05/2021, 11:01 - +44 7752 359588: Also! We have been watching the Awkwafina show on iPlayer and enjoying it!
07/05/2021, 11:01 - +44 7752 359588: Would recommend
07/05/2021, 11:01 - +44 7752 359588: It's basically Awkwafina meets Broad City
07/05/2021, 11:01 - James Kemp: I think they _are_ the lesbian thing?!
07/05/2021, 11:04 - James Kemp: https://thetab.com/uk/2021/05/06/cock-destroyers-have-fallen-out-reactions-204262
07/05/2021, 11:04 - James Kemp: What was said in that viscous email?!
07/05/2021, 11:09 - +44 7462 872590: Yas Queen! Sounds good.
07/05/2021, 11:11 - +44 7752 359588: I'm sorry did they really have a tv show?
07/05/2021, 11:12 - +44 7752 359588: I love a bit of shady tweeting
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Yeah I also only just discovered this
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Slag Wars
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Produced by Men.com - one of the biggest gay porn sites
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Oops
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Auto link
07/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Lmao
07/05/2021, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: Haaa
07/05/2021, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, having just read an article about slag wars, would give it a watch
07/05/2021, 13:48 - +44 7752 359588: I am being a big slacker and just doing my eurovision selection now
07/05/2021, 13:49 - +44 7752 359588: And let me tell you - serbia has only been around for 12 years, but it has slapped for a lot of those 12
07/05/2021, 13:49 - +44 7752 359588: I mean they gave us bojana and the loco loco ladies this year
07/05/2021, 13:50 - +44 7752 359588: Plus, I'm not selecting it, but they actually won the very first year they entered - WITH A SERBIAN BALLAD SUNG BY A LESBIAN IN A SUIT
07/05/2021, 13:50 - +44 7752 359588: Strong energy there
07/05/2021, 13:52 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice!
07/05/2021, 13:54 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow. That haircut is not a winner though is it
07/05/2021, 13:55 - +44 7752 359588: Her back up singers have equally baffling haircuts
07/05/2021, 13:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Also could never imagine women fondling each other being less hot
07/05/2021, 13:58 - Reuben Yarwood: Just awkwardly touching each other's shoulders and sniffing each others' hair
07/05/2021, 13:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Hell of a voice though. Vaguely remember her winning
07/05/2021, 14:42 - James Kemp: I am so pumped for Eurovision!!
07/05/2021, 14:42 - James Kemp: My piece of trivia from hunting is
07/05/2021, 14:42 - James Kemp: Did you know that Dita Von Tees joined Germany‚Äôs entry one year in the mid 00s?!
07/05/2021, 14:42 - James Kemp: I was gagged!
07/05/2021, 14:43 - Aaron Ayling: That's pretty cool!
07/05/2021, 14:44 - James Kemp: She was unfortunately the only good thing about says entry
07/05/2021, 14:44 - +44 7752 359588: Wat
07/05/2021, 14:44 - +44 7752 359588: Wild
07/05/2021, 14:44 - James Kemp: Yeah, she‚Äôs just on stage with them slinking around
07/05/2021, 14:45 - Aaron Ayling: The Flo Rida of the mid 00s
07/05/2021, 14:45 - James Kemp: Have you made your pick then, Liz?!
07/05/2021, 14:45 - +44 7752 359588: Almost!! Classically torn between something v naff and something catchy
07/05/2021, 14:45 - James Kemp: The classic choice
07/05/2021, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: I do love a naff entry and serbia has definitely had some naffness
07/05/2021, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: They also love a girl group which is fun
07/05/2021, 14:47 - +44 7462 872590: Very naff and catchy sums up Covid pretty well.
07/05/2021, 14:49 - James Kemp: From watching all of Israel‚Äôs and Germany‚Äôs, god there was a lot of shite
07/05/2021, 14:49 - James Kemp: Germany especially
07/05/2021, 14:49 - James Kemp: 500 songs about love being a bridge
07/05/2021, 14:49 - James Kemp: Also they had a song called SING SANG SONG one year which was obv big drag race vibes
07/05/2021, 14:49 - James Kemp: But slapped nowhere near as hard
07/05/2021, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
07/05/2021, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: Disappointing
07/05/2021, 14:58 - +44 7752 359588: Ok question for the group: for 2 years, serbia competed as serbia and Montenegro - could I use one of those songs if I chose?
07/05/2021, 15:01 - James Kemp: Definitely!
07/05/2021, 15:01 - James Kemp: Mama this ain‚Äôt the UN
07/05/2021, 15:04 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
07/05/2021, 15:05 - +44 7752 359588: Haha i don't want to anger the eurovision gods
07/05/2021, 15:05 - +44 7752 359588: Of the Serbian nationalists
07/05/2021, 15:05 - James Kemp: How many entries we got total!
07/05/2021, 15:05 - James Kemp: *?
07/05/2021, 15:05 - +44 7752 359588: I think just 8
07/05/2021, 15:05 - James Kemp: Fab!!
07/05/2021, 15:10 - Aaron Ayling: Also I am finding a lot of vids with the little preamble/propaganda video at the beginning and I would vote to submit that if you find it
07/05/2021, 15:53 - Sam Lea: Shots of artists fannying around near famous sights of host nation?
07/05/2021, 15:53 - Sam Lea: That kind of thing?
07/05/2021, 15:53 - James Kemp: Sadly mine doesn‚Äôt come with that! üòî
07/05/2021, 15:54 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah!
07/05/2021, 15:55 - Aaron Ayling: Only if its a possibility. Yugoslavia was slim pickings but think I found something that will give sufficient entertainment
07/05/2021, 15:55 - James Kemp: Ha
07/05/2021, 15:56 - James Kemp: Love the bar of ‚Äúsufficient entertainment‚Äù
07/05/2021, 15:56 - James Kemp: Expectations fully regulated
07/05/2021, 17:38 - +44 7752 359588: https://v.redd.it/r619jhjogkx61
07/05/2021, 17:38 - +44 7752 359588: A eurovision meme for you all
07/05/2021, 17:55 - James Kemp: This felt like a series of in jokes that I was only half in on?!
07/05/2021, 17:55 - James Kemp: Look at you with your (Eurovision) knowledge!!
07/05/2021, 17:55 - James Kemp: This is why you‚Äôre our glorious host tbf
07/05/2021, 17:56 - +44 7752 359588: It all comes from the subreddit
07/05/2021, 17:56 - +44 7752 359588: Where I also found this spectacularly shady comment:
07/05/2021, 17:57 - +44 7752 359588: KEiiNO's whole thing was being a group of three people from demographics underrepresented in the Norwegian music industry - Fred (Sami), Alexandra (not traditionally thin/attractive) and Tom (gay).
07/05/2021, 17:57 - +44 7752 359588: Please share with Dani, I think he'll enjoy it
07/05/2021, 17:57 - +44 7752 359588: Poor Alexandra
07/05/2021, 17:58 - James Kemp: Alexandra is really stretching her membership there
07/05/2021, 17:58 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit fug‚Äù
07/05/2021, 17:58 - +44 7752 359588: I'm also not sure if this is true or just this dude's take
07/05/2021, 17:58 - +44 7752 359588: She's also not even fug!
07/05/2021, 17:58 - James Kemp: Yeah I know??!
07/05/2021, 17:58 - James Kemp: Well whenever I climax I now scream
07/05/2021, 17:58 - James Kemp: THE KWEEEEEEEEEN
07/05/2021, 17:59 - James Kemp: OF THE NIGHT IS CUUUUUMMING
07/05/2021, 17:59 - +44 7752 359588: Hahahahaha
07/05/2021, 17:59 - +44 7752 359588: I am a big fan of that song tbf

07/05/2021, 18:04 - +44 7752 359588: Honestly unclear to me - either whoever made it has a hard on for the band or thinks they're gonna win?
07/05/2021, 18:04 - +44 7752 359588: I personally don't find Denmark that impressive this year

08/05/2021, 11:36 - +44 7462 872590: Works for me!
08/05/2021, 11:37 - James Kemp: Yep!
08/05/2021, 11:38 - +44 7752 359588: Fair warning, much lower production value than last year's
08/05/2021, 11:38 - +44 7752 359588: Imagine if San Marino won and had to actually host

08/05/2021, 22:24 - James Kemp: I love the Cameo: ‚Äúremember to cheer all the contestants... up!‚Äù
08/05/2021, 22:26 - +44 7752 359588: Yes objectively the better tune - it is a banger
08/05/2021, 22:26 - +44 7752 359588: I just couldn't resist a dude playing air violin
09/05/2021, 12:36 - Reuben Yarwood: https://youtu.be/LGHNEpTNcXU
09/05/2021, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Almost picked this one by the way - UKs first ever entry!
09/05/2021, 12:38 - James Kemp: Like the retro vibe but doesn‚Äôt slap as hard as your choice??
09/05/2021, 12:38 - James Kemp: This was my reserve:
09/05/2021, 12:39 - James Kemp: https://youtu.be/acOZVEN5XjE
09/05/2021, 12:39 - James Kemp: Somehow didn‚Äôt even qualify?!
09/05/2021, 12:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah you sort of expect little animated birds to come and fly around her head
09/05/2021, 12:40 - Reuben Yarwood: Kind of Evanescence vibes
09/05/2021, 12:40 - Reuben Yarwood: And then Eurodisco chorus!
09/05/2021, 12:41 - James Kemp: I love the way she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an animalincaptivity‚Äù

09/05/2021, 12:44 - Reuben Yarwood: The music is way too polished though
09/05/2021, 12:45 - James Kemp: Yeah it‚Äôs actually pretty fun?!
09/05/2021, 12:46 - James Kemp: I feel like it‚Äôs a shame that that big medley they do with all the stars ends up with them singing Black Eyed Peas
09/05/2021, 12:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah bit random
09/05/2021, 12:46 - James Kemp: But I guess they‚Äôre partly catering for an American audience who doesn‚Äôt know Eurovision?
09/05/2021, 12:46 - Reuben Yarwood: But it's made for an American audience right? So they had to get some stuff in for them
09/05/2021, 12:47 - James Kemp: Snap
09/05/2021, 12:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Great minds
09/05/2021, 12:47 - James Kemp: Also Rachel McAdams is big babe

09/05/2021, 12:55 - +44 7752 359588: That sort of feels in poor taste
09/05/2021, 12:56 - James Kemp: Awful taste?!
09/05/2021, 12:56 - +44 7752 359588: I do wonder how many of the celebs I'll actually recognize
09/05/2021, 12:57 - +44 7752 359588: Or will it all be pure oz

09/05/2021, 17:57 - +44 7752 359588: Question from my mom for the lads: when you were age 7, would you have wanted a stuffed toy, or is that not appealing to 7 year old boys
09/05/2021, 17:58 - Reuben Yarwood: I was probs still into beanie babies at 7. But I had younger siblings and think we used to play with them together
09/05/2021, 17:58 - Reuben Yarwood: Would probs go for some sort of nerf automatic rifle
09/05/2021, 17:59 - +44 7462 872590: üíØ
09/05/2021, 17:59 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I was obsessed with stuffed animals until like age 12, but I think she doesn't want to assume other kids are hahaha
09/05/2021, 17:59 - +44 7752 359588: Don't think the parents would be too fond of this
09/05/2021, 17:59 - +44 7752 359588: Basically she's getting the younger siblings stuffed animals, but doesn't want the older one to feel left out
09/05/2021, 18:00 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
09/05/2021, 18:00 - Reuben Yarwood: Not this then...?

09/05/2021, 18:38 - James Kemp: I had time!!
09/05/2021, 18:39 - James Kemp: Most of the toys I actually wanted (Barbies and that Barbie head you could style the hair of) were off limits tho
10/05/2021, 12:27 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
10/05/2021, 12:28 - Aaron Ayling: get the cap on!

10/05/2021, 12:29 - James Kemp: Been primed for a lot of that yep
10/05/2021, 12:29 - James Kemp: So far just reading a lot of docs
10/05/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: My fun fact from which is that the country which makes up the largest portion of non UK emigration to Hackney is Australia!
10/05/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: Maybe unsurprising
10/05/2021, 12:31 - Aaron Ayling: Johnny pumping those numbers up
10/05/2021, 12:37 - +61 474 759 280: Barely ever heard any Aussies in Hackney really
10/05/2021, 12:37 - +61 474 759 280: Love this
10/05/2021, 12:37 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah I find this surprising
10/05/2021, 12:38 - James Kemp: US is second, apparently
10/05/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: I guess if someone comes from another country and lives in like Liverpool for a few months and then to hackney it wouldn't count?
10/05/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: I feel attacked
10/05/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Altho again, my first stop was technically Westminster
10/05/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Glad the first day is going well!
10/05/2021, 14:09 - James Kemp: I had a choice of lanyard colour

10/05/2021, 14:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Not sure if I'll be in London yet Ed but will be there if so!
10/05/2021, 15:01 - +44 7462 872590: I probably won't be down either by then, but hopefully soon!

11/05/2021, 16:11 - +44 7752 359588: Living the life!
11/05/2021, 16:12 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, dolly has a horrible new version that got included in some horrible advert about hustles
11/05/2021, 16:12 - +44 7752 359588: Working 5-9
11/05/2021, 16:12 - +44 7752 359588: It's disgusting
11/05/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: Ew!
11/05/2021, 19:06 - +44 7752 359588: I don't know who else (besides Jim) is watching drag race down under, but Karen From Finance's boy look is very guy fieri and it delights me

13/05/2021, 13:50 - James Kemp: Fully at home, customer service advisor for a TBC Spanish speaking travel company
13/05/2021, 13:51 - James Kemp: TBC as it‚Äôs through a recruiter who are keeping the employer confidential until references are passed (bizarre)
13/05/2021, 13:51 - Aaron Ayling: Oh sounds perfect
13/05/2021, 13:51 - +44 7752 359588: That's a bit weird

13/05/2021, 13:52 - James Kemp: Yeah, but it‚Äôs all legit - I‚Äôve done my due diligence
13/05/2021, 13:52 - James Kemp: Might be a bit janky - he was offered the job after a v quick interview, but let‚Äôs see!!
13/05/2021, 13:52 - Aaron Ayling: Maybe so you don't go straight to them and bypass the recruiter fees?
13/05/2021, 13:53 - James Kemp: I figure because it‚Äôs so entry level, the recruitment has been pretty lax
13/05/2021, 13:53 - Aaron Ayling: Well sounds like a good step on the ladder!
13/05/2021, 13:53 - James Kemp: Yes!!

14/05/2021, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: Management training I'm on just made us write down the word assume, then draw lines, for a drawn out delivery of the joke when you assume you make an ass out of you and me
14/05/2021, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: Jesus
14/05/2021, 11:54 - Aaron Ayling: Who doesn't already know that thing???
14/05/2021, 11:55 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently half the people in this training
14/05/2021, 11:55 - +44 7752 359588: Or they're good actors haha
14/05/2021, 11:55 - +44 7752 359588: Also I am too anti-work for this training
14/05/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: Did they assume that you hadn‚Äôt done it before?!
14/05/2021, 11:56 - +44 7752 359588: Delivery of outcomes is literally never going to be more important to me than the people I work with
14/05/2021, 11:56 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
14/05/2021, 11:56 - James Kemp: Also I‚Äôm sorry but if you assume something about me, that in no way makes me an ass üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

16/05/2021, 08:11 - +61 474 759 280: Really well, they are old man angels
16/05/2021, 08:12 - +61 474 759 280: There‚Äôs a story behind that: the one in blue was coordinating all of them. The two in argyle are single and live together. The one in blue explicitly asked them NOT to wear those jumpers, and they did out of spite ‚ù§Ô∏è
16/05/2021, 08:17 - +44 7752 359588: This is the cutest thing I have heard in ages

17/05/2021, 11:32 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh didn't know you were in a book club! Does it have a theme?
18/05/2021, 02:28 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs with the local labor branch so I guess the theme is basically just lefty stuff. All non-fiction so far but not closed off to it
18/05/2021, 02:29 - +61 474 759 280: Yep, the prime minister!
18/05/2021, 02:29 - +61 474 759 280: He was also our most progressive leader ever so people are especially dark on it
18/05/2021, 11:29 - James Kemp: Booking Dani‚Äôs vaccine as we speak!
18/05/2021, 11:29 - James Kemp: NHS website has come down to his age

18/05/2021, 11:29 - James Kemp: Must‚Äôve just changed as there‚Äôs never been a queue to book before but now there is
18/05/2021, 11:30 - +44 7752 359588: Oh that's crazy
18/05/2021, 11:30 - +44 7752 359588: Guess lots of people jumping on it, especially as stuff opens
18/05/2021, 11:30 - James Kemp: Yeah
18/05/2021, 11:35 - James Kemp: NHS booking is way more t
18/05/2021, 11:35 - James Kemp: You get a choice of every centre and get to book your second one!
18/05/2021, 11:36 - James Kemp: His is on Tues!
18/05/2021, 11:38 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh that's definitely nicer
18/05/2021, 11:38 - +44 7752 359588: But hey, I'll take getting it a bit earlier even if I get fewer options
18/05/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: I mean, he‚Äôs ended up getting it earlier than us at the same time
18/05/2021, 11:39 - James Kemp: üò¨

18/05/2021, 11:40 - James Kemp: My sister is gagging
18/05/2021, 11:40 - James Kemp: 4 years older than me

18/05/2021, 11:42 - +44 7752 359588: Wales living the dream the rest of the uk can only fantasize about
18/05/2021, 11:43 - +44 7462 872590: üòé
18/05/2021, 11:43 - James Kemp: Also tbf George you are worth more than all of us put together

18/05/2021, 11:51 - James Kemp: I wonder if there are gonna be any controversial non qualifiers
18/05/2021, 11:51 - James Kemp: A moment‚Äôs silence for FAGE FAGE (natural Greek yoghurt): https://open.spotify.com/track/39eYn0el1oFv3btrhTX74G?si=Fai7_EQkSgOTqXgoSW3wMA
18/05/2021, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: I think semi final one has a lot of the big faves for this year in it, so potentially yes
18/05/2021, 11:55 - Aaron Ayling: I only found out the other day Dana International came back a few years after winning and didn't make it through the semis haha
18/05/2021, 11:55 - Aaron Ayling: Never come back!
18/05/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: Yep! That featured in my Israel watching!
18/05/2021, 11:56 - James Kemp: It was truly trash tbf
18/05/2021, 11:57 - James Kemp: Dani is obsessed with this reimagining: https://youtu.be/rrg34UbqQkQ (add it to your next Eurovision YouTube sesh)
18/05/2021, 11:58 - James Kemp: Although Liz I think you will find it gross
18/05/2021, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: This is A LOT
18/05/2021, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: But I kind of like it
18/05/2021, 12:00 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs a jam tho?
18/05/2021, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: Very there for the phallic snake and cactus imagery, especially when the dude is about to lick the spikey cactus
18/05/2021, 12:01 - +44 7752 359588: It's a solid remix!
18/05/2021, 12:01 - James Kemp: Also she looks great twenty years on?!

19/05/2021, 08:52 - +44 7752 359588: Also RIP Australia's Eurovision qualifying streak
19/05/2021, 08:55 - James Kemp: Yeah the novelty has officially worn _off_!
19/05/2021, 08:56 - Aaron Ayling: Long live Ukraine's!
19/05/2021, 09:47 - Aaron Ayling: Just got jabbed with some Pfizer

19/05/2021, 09:53 - Reuben Yarwood: Congrats!
19/05/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: Woooooooooooo!!
19/05/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: Next pic licking a pavement plz
19/05/2021, 10:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Have you had yours Liz?
19/05/2021, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: Not yet
19/05/2021, 10:14 - Reuben Yarwood: No word on me getting one yet. Maybe because Cheshire's average age is about 60
19/05/2021, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: Mine is next Wednesday
19/05/2021, 10:15 - +44 7752 359588: I reckon the national age cut off will drop again soon, so hopefully won't be too long for you
19/05/2021, 10:15 - James Kemp: BACK OF THE LINE, TAPIOKA
19/05/2021, 10:15 - James Kemp: Mansplaining maths but it seemed to take a week to go from 38 to 36
19/05/2021, 10:16 - James Kemp: So another couple weeks??
19/05/2021, 10:16 - James Kemp: (I was checking every day for Dani)
19/05/2021, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice one! Not long then
19/05/2021, 10:37 - Sam Lea: Yeah I was wondering this - are they prioritising the big cities over the likes of East Cheshire
19/05/2021, 10:46 - Aaron Ayling: Well once the NHS website lowers to your age group you can get jabbed anywhere, so I don't think it's a case of prioritising areas, maybe just more local areas have different demographics etc.

We all got ahead of the queue coz we got a GP text and it looked like there were people queueing up outside the vaccine centre to get any surplus shots that were going without an appointment
19/05/2021, 11:01 - Sam Lea: ahh gotcha
19/05/2021, 11:10 - James Kemp: My induction here tells me that Hackney is indeed a very young borough
19/05/2021, 11:10 - James Kemp: So that may well factor in with our GP being so litty!
19/05/2021, 11:11 - James Kemp: There‚Äôs also some Haredi awareness training I can go on if I want
19/05/2021, 11:12 - James Kemp: Curious enough that I might sign up
19/05/2021, 11:12 - +44 7752 359588: I think that would be super interesting
19/05/2021, 11:12 - James Kemp: Yeah I thought so too!
19/05/2021, 11:12 - +44 7752 359588: I want you to go so you can tell me the t
19/05/2021, 11:12 - James Kemp: Biggest Haredi population in Europe!
19/05/2021, 11:13 - +44 7752 359588: Not shocked to hear this, but hadn't ever thought about that
19/05/2021, 11:13 - +44 7752 359588: Kind of cool
19/05/2021, 11:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Is that another name for Hassidic?
19/05/2021, 11:50 - Reuben Yarwood: I would be well curious about that
19/05/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: Slightly different terms apparently
19/05/2021, 11:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Lesson one
19/05/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: Did a quick google and cba getting to the bottom of it rn
19/05/2021, 11:51 - James Kemp: But seemed almost interchangeable but not quite ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
19/05/2021, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: I think it's sort of different types? But both generally quite conservative/orthodox?
19/05/2021, 13:46 - James Kemp: Two instances of nominative determinism today...
19/05/2021, 13:47 - James Kemp: Dani having an interview for receptionist of a prosthetics provider with Ms Susan Foote
19/05/2021, 13:47 - James Kemp: I‚Äôve just booked a meeting with the personal who handles engagement of local Hackney councillors...
19/05/2021, 13:47 - James Kemp: Jacqueline Comitti
19/05/2021, 13:47 - James Kemp: LOOOOL
19/05/2021, 13:48 - Aaron Ayling: Hahaha
19/05/2021, 13:48 - Aaron Ayling: Also hope this goes well!
19/05/2021, 13:48 - James Kemp: She was born to do this!!
19/05/2021, 13:49 - James Kemp: Tyty!!
19/05/2021, 13:49 - James Kemp: Quite a few interviews coming through atm but still a tonne of competition obv
19/05/2021, 13:49 - +44 7752 359588: Yes good luck to Dani!
19/05/2021, 13:50 - +44 7752 359588: This made me actually laugh out loud
19/05/2021, 13:50 - +44 7752 359588: It's so good
19/05/2021, 16:11 - James Kemp: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-57171712
19/05/2021, 16:12 - James Kemp: They‚Äôre still in
19/05/2021, 16:12 - James Kemp: But without live footage
19/05/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: Given all the rumblings that the lack of being live tanked Oz with the judges, not great for them...
19/05/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: Not that they really seem a contender this year anyway?
19/05/2021, 16:13 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs all about Iceland 2020 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
19/05/2021, 16:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Gutted!
19/05/2021, 16:15 - +44 7752 359588: NOOOO
19/05/2021, 16:15 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh I feel terrible for them
19/05/2021, 16:16 - +44 7752 359588: It's got to be such a disappointment
19/05/2021, 16:17 - Sam Lea: absolutely cursed
20/05/2021, 00:14 - +61 474 759 280: This story has it all:

20/05/2021, 09:02 - James Kemp: Already down to 34
20/05/2021, 09:03 - James Kemp: At this rate, you outstanding slags will be booked wuthin the week!
20/05/2021, 09:11 - +44 7752 359588: How exciting!
20/05/2021, 09:20 - +61 474 759 280: @447725504296 @447940330084 are you out of the crypto game?
20/05/2021, 09:31 - Reuben Yarwood: I've had a stressful couple of days
20/05/2021, 09:31 - +61 474 759 280: Omg
20/05/2021, 09:32 - Aaron Ayling: I'm out the loop - what's been going on?
20/05/2021, 09:32 - Aaron Ayling: And how much money would I have made if I had chucked ¬£100 on doge pin when I said to @447725504296
20/05/2021, 09:32 - Aaron Ayling: Doge coin
20/05/2021, 09:32 - Reuben Yarwood: The bubble's burst basically.
20/05/2021, 09:33 - Reuben Yarwood: As far as I understand it, it started with Elon Musk bashing bitcoin for being shit for the environment
20/05/2021, 09:34 - Aaron Ayling: Ooh I wondered if this would have an impact
20/05/2021, 09:34 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ
20/05/2021, 09:34 - Reuben Yarwood: And then People's Bank of China reiterated a statement that crypto currency transactions would not be allowed by Chinese institutions
20/05/2021, 09:35 - James Kemp: So how has it impacted you??
20/05/2021, 09:37 - +44 7752 359588: I mean Elon musk is a dick, but he isn't wrong
20/05/2021, 09:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah he's right, I didn't buy any bitcoin for that reason
20/05/2021, 09:37 - Reuben Yarwood: But they pretty much all follow bitcoin to a t
20/05/2021, 09:37 - Reuben Yarwood: So when that dropped it all dropped
20/05/2021, 09:38 - Reuben Yarwood: @Aaron you'd still have ¬£750
20/05/2021, 09:38 - Edward Beesley: As Marilyn Monroe (possibly) once said - if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best. Time to buy the dip!
20/05/2021, 09:39 - Reuben Yarwood: My stuff has gone down a grand. But as they say it's risky business! And it'll probably trickle back up.
20/05/2021, 09:39 - Reuben Yarwood: If not then I'll be gutted but not bankrupt
20/05/2021, 09:40 - Aaron Ayling: But the peak could have been ¬£2000+ eh? That's a decent drop!
20/05/2021, 09:42 - James Kemp: I hung out with Abby last night and she‚Äôs already finished the second book!
20/05/2021, 09:42 - Reuben Yarwood: No! That was quick
20/05/2021, 09:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Is it going to be as horrible as the first one
20/05/2021, 09:43 - James Kemp: It seems very Mysterious Skin?
20/05/2021, 09:43 - James Kemp: Called The Conspiracies
20/05/2021, 09:44 - James Kemp: Follows the aftermath of a school shooting in the UK; apparently two main characters - one whose mum was a teacher and died; another whose pushing that the whole thing is a conspiracy
20/05/2021, 09:44 - Reuben Yarwood: God she love a dark drama doesn't she
20/05/2021, 09:44 - James Kemp: Dark mama

20/05/2021, 09:45 - Reuben Yarwood: Have we ever had a school shooting?
20/05/2021, 09:45 - +44 7752 359588: Is she going to be a full time writer?
20/05/2021, 09:45 - +44 7752 359588: Oh jeez

20/05/2021, 09:46 - James Kemp: She said not! Likes balancing it with a job where she works with other people, etc
20/05/2021, 09:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Pretty frikkin amazing she can publish two books while being a lawyer for Google
20/05/2021, 09:49 - +44 7752 359588: Get it Abby! I'm very impressed
20/05/2021, 09:49 - James Kemp: She‚Äôs also now pregnant!
20/05/2021, 09:50 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah like when does she find the time (I assume it's during the time I usually spend fucking around on my phone(
20/05/2021, 09:50 - +44 7752 359588: DAMN
20/05/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: Apparently it‚Äôs been a pretty quite time at ole Googel
20/05/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: Which she was obv grateful for!
20/05/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: *quiet
20/05/2021, 09:51 - +44 7752 359588: Jim I think I should stay away from you... You clearly are cursing all your friends with vabies
20/05/2021, 09:51 - James Kemp: Vabies
20/05/2021, 09:51 - James Kemp: Rabies or babies?
20/05/2021, 09:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Vabies sounds like a horrible STI
20/05/2021, 09:51 - Sam Lea: it's a serious condition
20/05/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: Also Liz if you don‚Äôt wanna be friends anymore just say, jeez

20/05/2021, 09:52 - +61 474 759 280: I think I take a cream for vabies
20/05/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: Rupaul in da hauuuus
20/05/2021, 09:55 - Sam Lea: I think my fave mo was the insane dogecoin hype in the week leading up to his SNL appearance where it nearly hit a dollar, 80 cents or something like that... and then he comes on and immediately agrees with someone who says, to paraphrase, "dogecoin is essentially just a big hustle, isn't it"
20/05/2021, 09:55 - Sam Lea: cue precipitous fall in value
20/05/2021, 09:58 - Aaron Ayling: Especially coz everyone thinks he's a funny meme guy that would keep it going for the lolz
20/05/2021, 13:12 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>

23/05/2021, 09:54 - +44 7462 872590: And we'd always get 1 point as a default

25/05/2021, 14:50 - +61 474 759 280: Which I didn‚Äôt notice when I ordered them, not mad about that tho
25/05/2021, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: I think the fact that you can't stack these would kill me
25/05/2021, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: But coming from a 4-glass household I am impressed by the sheer number
25/05/2021, 14:52 - +61 474 759 280: I assume I‚Äôll have smashed 8 in the first month
25/05/2021, 14:53 - James Kemp: We drank Prosecco from saucer glasses on Eurovision night and that is truly a mood I want to embrace for the rest of my 39s

26/05/2021, 11:58 - Aaron Ayling: Dominic Cummings has entered that pointing spider man meme into the British Parliamentary Record
26/05/2021, 11:59 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs great
26/05/2021, 12:00 - +61 474 759 280: Another example of how Tories play politics on easy mode
26/05/2021, 12:01 - Aaron Ayling: What might actually bring down Boris is the revelations from the mirror today that he thought that super league was a good idea
26/05/2021, 12:03 - +44 7752 359588: The whole thing has been hilarious
26/05/2021, 12:03 - +44 7752 359588: Cummings described himself as not smart
26/05/2021, 12:18 - +44 7462 872590: He keeps referencing Jeff Goldblum in Independence Day
26/05/2021, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: Jesus why?
26/05/2021, 12:20 - +44 7462 872590: Why not?
26/05/2021, 12:20 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
26/05/2021, 12:29 - +44 7462 872590: Dominic Cummings: "We've got to get a grip of Hancock." 

Come on mate, not the right time for jokes.
26/05/2021, 12:34 - +44 7752 359588: This just feels like a thick of it plotline really
26/05/2021, 12:34 - +44 7752 359588: But it's nice to know Cummings is up to date on his memes
26/05/2021, 12:34 - +44 7462 872590: üíØ
26/05/2021, 12:59 - James Kemp: Wait is Cummings still not a villain?
26/05/2021, 13:01 - Aaron Ayling: Oh no he is, but he's being a snitch to try and save his own skin
26/05/2021, 13:01 - James Kemp: Randall
26/05/2021, 13:01 - +44 7752 359588: Oh yeah he's such a slimy villain and I love him just throwing everyone under the bus to save himself
26/05/2021, 13:02 - +44 7752 359588: Except rishi sunak
26/05/2021, 13:02 - +44 7752 359588: He seems to be defending him
26/05/2021, 13:03 - Aaron Ayling: Play to get back in once rishi's in power eh
26/05/2021, 13:03 - Aaron Ayling: He reads the writing on the wall
26/05/2021, 13:03 - Aaron Ayling: I bet he's defending Gove too
26/05/2021, 13:03 - +44 7752 359588: If rishi sunak ever becomes prime minister I am going to die
26/05/2021, 13:03 - James Kemp: PISSY POONAK
26/05/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: Fulbright will never shut up about it
26/05/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: And he's the wooooorst
26/05/2021, 13:13 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm ignorant and just took his self employed grants and was happy. Do you think he fucked up?
26/05/2021, 13:15 - +44 7752 359588: I don't know that he fucked up, but just is a standard conservative asshat
26/05/2021, 13:15 - +44 7752 359588: Voted against gay rights all that good stuff
26/05/2021, 13:15 - James Kemp: Also he‚Äôs not white and he‚Äôs a Tory

26/05/2021, 14:38 - +44 7752 359588: THE RUDENESS
26/05/2021, 14:38 - +61 474 759 280: Looooooooool

26/05/2021, 14:43 - +44 7752 359588: This is horrible and I love it
26/05/2021, 15:00 - +44 7752 359588: Also initial thoughts on timothee chalamet playing young willy Wonka in a musical???
26/05/2021, 15:01 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like it will be disturbingly hot
26/05/2021, 15:01 - Sam Lea: Was always holding out hope for Gosling to be Wonka one day
26/05/2021, 15:01 - +44 7752 359588: Tell me more about this - that also feels like a weird casting choice
26/05/2021, 15:02 - Sam Lea: I just think he bears more than a passing facial and vocal resemblance to Gene Wilder!
26/05/2021, 15:02 - Sam Lea: And therefore it'd be fun
26/05/2021, 15:02 - Sam Lea: (to see him do it)
26/05/2021, 15:02 - +44 7752 359588: I can see this!
26/05/2021, 15:03 - +44 7752 359588: I guess timothee gives us more of the Depp Wonka doesn't he
26/05/2021, 15:03 - +44 7752 359588: Dark haired, manic
26/05/2021, 15:03 - +44 7752 359588: I want a dark oompa loompa enslavement story
26/05/2021, 15:04 - James Kemp: NOT ANOTHER ONE is my thoughts to this
26/05/2021, 15:04 - +44 7752 359588: It's apparently an origin story?
26/05/2021, 15:04 - James Kemp: Feel like Burton‚Äôs Willy Wonks was so recent?!
26/05/2021, 15:04 - +44 7752 359588: So not charlie and the chocolate factory, but like where does willy Wonka come from
26/05/2021, 15:04 - James Kemp: Maybe a sign that I‚Äôm a grandma because on reflection, I actually think I saw it the day I finished my GCSEs?
26/05/2021, 15:04 - +44 7752 359588: Which I support because Charlie is a whiny little b
26/05/2021, 15:05 - James Kemp: Yeah Charlie you‚Äôre poor boohoo
26/05/2021, 15:05 - James Kemp: His love of all those gross old people always got a boot from me

26/05/2021, 17:37 - James Kemp: Maybe they‚Äôre making a comeback
26/05/2021, 18:00 - Sam Lea: Or maybe they're just big fans of Resident Advisor, the online music magazine dedicated to showcasing electronic music, artists and events üôÇ
26/05/2021, 18:03 - James Kemp: Alright lads
26/05/2021, 18:03 - James Kemp: Mama‚Äôs getting pumped

27/05/2021, 07:13 - +61 474 759 280: We‚Äôre basically a victim of our own success at this point. We only have 24 cases but our strategy is to eradicate it rather than letting it rip
27/05/2021, 07:13 - +61 474 759 280: And we fucked up our vaccination program so we‚Äôre in a weird limbo for the next year üëç
27/05/2021, 08:10 - +44 7462 872590: Oh no! Sorry to hear that. How long are you going into lockdown? Will this ramp up the vaccination program do you think?
27/05/2021, 08:15 - Aaron Ayling: Oh boo that sucks
27/05/2021, 08:26 - +61 474 759 280: 7 days. Yeah. But some commentators are worried it‚Äôll be too effective in driving demand, because we only have enough doses for a fraction of the population
27/05/2021, 08:34 - +44 7462 872590: What's the plan... Eyeing up some Netflix series?
27/05/2021, 08:35 - +61 474 759 280: Moving to my new apartment
27/05/2021, 08:35 - +61 474 759 280: Total shitshow
27/05/2021, 08:39 - +44 7462 872590: OMG!
27/05/2021, 08:47 - +44 7462 872590: When are you actually moving?
27/05/2021, 08:47 - +61 474 759 280: Get the keys Monday, then cleaning and painting. Aim to have everything moved on Friday
27/05/2021, 08:49 - +44 7462 872590: Nice
27/05/2021, 08:54 - Aaron Ayling: Oh jeez what timing
27/05/2021, 08:55 - +44 7462 872590: Are you gonna do the painting?
27/05/2021, 08:55 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah, it‚Äôll actually be a good project while there‚Äôs fuck all to do
27/05/2021, 08:56 - +61 474 759 280: In theory
27/05/2021, 08:58 - +44 7462 872590: Cool. You _have_to wear dungarees when you paint
27/05/2021, 09:05 - +44 7752 359588: Godspeed
27/05/2021, 09:06 - +44 7752 359588: Any fun colors for painting?
27/05/2021, 09:19 - James Kemp: Yeah mama what‚Äôs yo _scheme_?

31/05/2021, 09:00 - +44 7752 359588: Holy hell

31/05/2021, 09:03 - +61 474 759 280: Dad hoards everything they want to ditch, will not let them throw anything out. He recently gave my nieces a basketball ring and backboard he‚Äôs had stored for 20 years.
31/05/2021, 09:03 - +61 474 759 280: Ahaha not yet, but I‚Äôm working on it
31/05/2021, 09:04 - +44 7752 359588: A man after my own father's heart
31/05/2021, 09:04 - +44 7752 359588: My parents have the ratchet kitchen stuff from my college apartment still, waiting for Aaron and I
31/05/2021, 09:04 - +44 7752 359588: It originally was left by some of my dad's tenants I think
31/05/2021, 09:04 - +44 7752 359588: So we've had it in and out of storage since I was 15/16
31/05/2021, 09:45 - +61 474 759 280: Hero
31/05/2021, 09:46 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs going to feel like the weirdest time warp

31/05/2021, 09:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Did a bit of a coastal walk yesterday
31/05/2021, 09:57 - Reuben Yarwood: I would say Hastings is like a rough around the edges version of Brighton with fewer tourists
31/05/2021, 10:20 - +44 7752 359588: This looks beautiful tho!;
31/05/2021, 10:20 - +44 7752 359588: How is the house?
31/05/2021, 10:21 - Reuben Yarwood: So they're renting at the moment right near the same square and waiting for all the paperwork to go through
31/05/2021, 10:21 - Reuben Yarwood: So haven't seen the flat yet but the rental place is great
31/05/2021, 10:32 - +44 7752 359588: Man I bet the walking is lush
31/05/2021, 10:47 - James Kemp: Oooh this all looks lovely!!
31/05/2021, 10:48 - James Kemp: V quiet weekend here! Dani got a cold which he then passed to me, so we‚Äôve been successively ill ü§ßüòÖ
31/05/2021, 10:48 - James Kemp: Then got this lingering rash on my arm from the vaccine! Annoying and sore but apparently nothing to worry about
31/05/2021, 10:49 - James Kemp: NO EXCITING PHOTOS SORRY
31/05/2021, 10:49 - James Kemp: Also this is a gag
31/05/2021, 10:50 - James Kemp: I wonder if she‚Äôll sue them?
31/05/2021, 10:50 - +61 474 759 280: Dunno, sounded fucking grim
31/05/2021, 10:51 - James Kemp: You‚Äôre obviously scott free but I imagine it‚Äôd be worth a pop looking into it for those sums dammmn?!
31/05/2021, 10:52 - James Kemp: But I am guessing she also signed the wrong bit of paper?
31/05/2021, 10:52 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah I don‚Äôt know. I suspect they ignored or doubled up on the 5% deposit I paid months ago which was about that much
31/05/2021, 10:52 - James Kemp: In which case she‚Äôs fucked lmaooooo
31/05/2021, 10:53 - James Kemp: Either way, sucks to suck, happy new home!!

31/05/2021, 10:54 - +61 474 759 280: It was because they bought a house to replace their apartment and their figures to cover the purchased factored in a mystery $35k that was complete fiction
31/05/2021, 10:54 - +61 474 759 280: Anyway that‚Äôs that, _the end_
31/05/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>

31/05/2021, 11:32 - +44 7752 359588: Is it super uncomfortable or does it just look bad?
31/05/2021, 11:33 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs kinda painful if I use my arm yeah
31/05/2021, 11:33 - James Kemp: So obviously fully indulging the drama
31/05/2021, 11:33 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha good
31/05/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: It appeared 24 hours after, which is apparently common - in some cases, bitches didn‚Äôt get it til 8 days after
31/05/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdelayed hypersensitivity‚Äù which is so my vibe
31/05/2021, 11:38 - James Kemp: Lazy but also dramatic ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
31/05/2021, 11:38 - +61 474 759 280: Damn!
31/05/2021, 11:39 - James Kemp: Obviously I scoured for sources when I thought death was approaching
31/05/2021, 11:41 - +61 474 759 280: Do people worry about blood clots over there or is that just us?
31/05/2021, 11:41 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs AstraZeneca
31/05/2021, 11:42 - James Kemp: Which they‚Äôre increasingly not using for our age group
31/05/2021, 11:42 - +61 474 759 280: Or you Pfizer??
31/05/2021, 11:42 - James Kemp: Yeah, and Dani Moderna
31/05/2021, 11:42 - +61 474 759 280: Oh*
31/05/2021, 11:42 - +61 474 759 280: Lovely
31/05/2021, 11:42 - James Kemp: I like this as your attempt at reassurance tho

31/05/2021, 11:43 - +61 474 759 280: Australians, unduly, worry about the clots
31/05/2021, 11:43 - James Kemp: Turns out I‚Äôm most afraid of death!!
31/05/2021, 11:43 - +61 474 759 280: Hahahaha

01/06/2021, 11:00 - +44 7752 359588: Nice to know some things never change
01/06/2021, 11:01 - James Kemp: Also when you‚Äôre the police and at that point you‚Äôve shaken up the whole spoons hornet nest...
01/06/2021, 11:01 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd just run

01/06/2021, 11:01 - Aaron Ayling: Apparently they were refused service for not following social distancing/mask guidelines, so they punched the manager
01/06/2021, 11:02 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
01/06/2021, 11:02 - +44 7752 359588: Not shocked at all
01/06/2021, 11:02 - Aaron Ayling: Imagining you in the corner desperately weighing up whether to wait for your food order or not as chairs fly around you
01/06/2021, 11:03 - +44 7752 359588: If you're a police officer and you're called to a spoons you would just know it's going to be a shitshow
01/06/2021, 11:03 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd lock myself in the cubicle while I waited probs

01/06/2021, 11:08 - +44 7752 359588: But furries in a spoons is a real uk life highlight for me

01/06/2021, 11:10 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm laughing at the idea of you lot turning up already completely smashed to see a Spoons full of furries
01/06/2021, 11:10 - Reuben Yarwood: Must have been bizarre
01/06/2021, 11:20 - +44 7752 359588: Ah completely forgot! I was also smashed obvs
01/06/2021, 11:20 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah I was delighted
01/06/2021, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: There weren't loads, just like a small gathering at a few tables
01/06/2021, 11:21 - +44 7752 359588: And sadly no full fursuits just some tails and maybe some ears

01/06/2021, 13:27 - +61 474 759 280: Because if so, probably quantity (silver/bronze) for me
01/06/2021, 13:34 - James Kemp: Bronze?!
01/06/2021, 13:34 - James Kemp: Is that just speed?
01/06/2021, 14:04 - +44 7752 359588: My fun Jeff mucha fact today (maybe of most interest to John): the rabbi who did my dad's bar mitzvah also did the funeral service for Jack Ruby (guy who shot Lee Harvey Oswald)
01/06/2021, 14:05 - +61 474 759 280: HOLY SHIT
01/06/2021, 14:06 - +61 474 759 280: Ok, might‚Äôve been a tad overexcited. Yes. I do find that interesting
01/06/2021, 14:06 - +44 7752 359588: Does this mean my dad is 5 degrees of separation from Kennedy? Assassinations count right
01/06/2021, 14:06 - +44 7752 359588: I think my dad just found this out - was watching some sort of tv programme on him
01/06/2021, 14:07 - +61 474 759 280: I was just listening to a podcast about Jack Ruby
01/06/2021, 14:07 - +61 474 759 280: He was a sketchy guy
01/06/2021, 14:07 - +44 7752 359588: I know literally nothing about him
01/06/2021, 14:07 - +44 7752 359588: Except I guess he was Jewish?

02/06/2021, 09:09 - James Kemp: Such a niche kink?
02/06/2021, 09:10 - James Kemp: Peach schnapps and garden furniture beatings?
02/06/2021, 09:17 - Aaron Ayling: Haha the guy with the chair was doing some terrible strikes
02/06/2021, 10:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah - when he just rams the leg into his back... I don't think that's what he had in mind!
02/06/2021, 10:10 - +61 474 759 280: Happy 29th Georgey boy!!

02/06/2021, 10:16 - +44 7752 359588: Yes a very very happy birthday! Enjoy that last year of your 20s!
02/06/2021, 10:17 - +44 7752 359588: It's that fresh, youthful face
02/06/2021, 10:17 - James Kemp: I suddenly feel way less old to know we‚Äôre (for the next 6 weeks at least) within a year of each other
02/06/2021, 10:17 - James Kemp: You‚Äôve been my barometer of youth
02/06/2021, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: Happy Birthday George!
02/06/2021, 10:25 - +44 7462 872590: Thanks guys!!! ü•∞

02/06/2021, 11:01 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah the weathers looking good. Got some beers from a local brewery some gonna having a tasting session!
02/06/2021, 11:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Nothing like a death defying ridge to celebrate being alive
02/06/2021, 11:01 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ
02/06/2021, 11:02 - +44 7752 359588: This sounds lovely!
02/06/2021, 11:02 - +44 7752 359588: Please give us your best and worst beer
02/06/2021, 11:02 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha, I think after the first few they'll all be the best beer
02/06/2021, 11:03 - +44 7752 359588: This is the best philosophy

02/06/2021, 11:41 - Aaron Ayling: It was the blurst of times?!
02/06/2021, 11:53 - +44 7752 359588: Today I have been blessed - dedicided I wanted some trash beer for the sun so ordered a big pack of moretti. And tesco just gave us 2 accidentally. Living my trash lager dream
02/06/2021, 11:55 - +61 474 759 280: Big win!
02/06/2021, 11:55 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
02/06/2021, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: I went to the Japanese embassy recently and they had one and even though I only needed a pee I was so tempted to use it anyway
02/06/2021, 12:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Yes!! Moretti is well classy compared to my Carlings
02/06/2021, 12:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Still got a couple left unfortunately
02/06/2021, 12:04 - +61 474 759 280: Morretti is actually not a bad beer
02/06/2021, 12:04 - Reuben Yarwood: 100% yes
02/06/2021, 12:07 - Sam Lea: drink a moretti to forgetti your regretti
02/06/2021, 12:07 - +44 7752 359588: Omg yes
02/06/2021, 12:07 - +44 7752 359588: I definitely want one of these one day
02/06/2021, 12:07 - Sam Lea: agreed
02/06/2021, 12:07 - +44 7752 359588: Haaaa
02/06/2021, 12:08 - +44 7752 359588: Weigh in: is asahi classier than moretti?
02/06/2021, 12:08 - +61 474 759 280: On par
02/06/2021, 12:08 - +44 7752 359588: Aaron rates them about the same, with a taste preference for Asahi, but I think asahi seems posher?
02/06/2021, 12:08 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe Japan is more exotic to me?
02/06/2021, 12:08 - +44 7752 359588: Plus you can't get like a 24 pack of asahi here
02/06/2021, 12:09 - +61 474 759 280: We don‚Äôt get Moretti here so I‚Äôm the opposite
02/06/2021, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: This also makes sense
02/06/2021, 12:13 - James Kemp: Agree on Asahi over Moretti for taste!
02/06/2021, 12:14 - James Kemp: I feel like Moretti tries harder to market itself as classier/EuRoPeAn
02/06/2021, 12:14 - James Kemp: Which in my mind makes it trasher?
02/06/2021, 12:14 - James Kemp: Never seen an Asahi ad by comparison ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
02/06/2021, 12:18 - Sam Lea: a sip of Asahi prompts *A Sigh* of satisfaction
02/06/2021, 12:20 - Aaron Ayling: Whereas Asahi is harder to find here so I think it's less trash
02/06/2021, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: But surely it is like a notch above a Stella or kronenberg
02/06/2021, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Although Stella has a better reputation in the us I think
02/06/2021, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Sometimes it's marketed as an "import"
02/06/2021, 12:23 - Aaron Ayling: Moretti is amongst the top of the trash league in my mind? Stella is mid-low
02/06/2021, 12:23 - Aaron Ayling: Carling - rock bottom definitely getting relegated
02/06/2021, 12:24 - +44 7752 359588: Would pop a Carling above a kronenberg controversially. But based on preference and not reputation
02/06/2021, 12:24 - Aaron Ayling: Are you getting Carlsberg and. Arling mixed up?
02/06/2021, 12:24 - Aaron Ayling: Carling *
02/06/2021, 12:25 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think so, but potentially yes hahaha
02/06/2021, 12:26 - James Kemp: Oh definitely!
02/06/2021, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: Only because I cannot see carling being anything other than shite
02/06/2021, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: I'd rather have a budweiser than a carling
02/06/2021, 12:27 - James Kemp: I just think that TASTE OF ITALY Moretti advert is so trash
02/06/2021, 12:27 - James Kemp: If it weren‚Äôt for that advert, I‚Äôd say Asahi is actually more trash than Moretti
02/06/2021, 12:27 - Aaron Ayling: Oh they are all so bad - remember that Peter Dinklage estrella movie?
02/06/2021, 12:27 - James Kemp: Omg the current Estrella one about saving turtles
02/06/2021, 12:28 - James Kemp: And then just the Estrella logo at the end

02/06/2021, 12:32 - James Kemp: Omg I cannot with this

02/06/2021, 12:33 - +61 474 759 280: Indulgent tosh
02/06/2021, 12:33 - James Kemp: Even when Lady Gaga does it for her music videos, I eye roll
02/06/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: Also I just discovered ibuprofen cream and it is CUM
02/06/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: Apparently my sister had COVID arm for weeks fml
02/06/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: Why are we genetically trash
02/06/2021, 12:34 - +44 7752 359588: Oh my god I forgot about this. I hope they paid peter dinklage out the ass for this
02/06/2021, 12:34 - Sam Lea: Bit of a swizz that - need to try harder with their ingredients
02/06/2021, 12:34 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh didn't even know this existed!!!!
02/06/2021, 12:34 - Sam Lea: Have you still got it?
02/06/2021, 12:35 - Aaron Ayling: Lol

03/06/2021, 09:28 - +61 474 759 280: Lol found on Twitter
03/06/2021, 09:44 - James Kemp: Public sector reasons to cancel meetings...

04/06/2021, 09:22 - +44 7752 359588: First time I've heard that one
04/06/2021, 09:36 - James Kemp: How close to the deadline?
04/06/2021, 09:36 - James Kemp: I feel like that is a key piece of data in my shady assessment
04/06/2021, 09:36 - +44 7752 359588: I mean it's just an arbitrary deadline for paperwork - we ask them to send it back within a week just so they don't sit on it forever
04/06/2021, 09:37 - +44 7752 359588: I think she has like 4-5 more days
04/06/2021, 09:37 - +44 7752 359588: But really it doesn't matter
04/06/2021, 09:37 - Reuben Yarwood: I feel like geography is a factor here, is she in Africa?
04/06/2021, 09:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Cause if she's in Hackney I'd be a bit sceptical
04/06/2021, 09:38 - James Kemp: Also is she Cheryl Cole?
04/06/2021, 09:38 - James Kemp: Because maybe she‚Äôs relapsed
04/06/2021, 09:39 - James Kemp: I feel like this is a question you should ask, just in case
04/06/2021, 09:41 - +44 7752 359588: So pretty sure yes - think she's living with her mom in Liberia
04/06/2021, 09:41 - +44 7752 359588: Slightly less skeptical
04/06/2021, 09:53 - James Kemp: So I was one of three senior strategists at given and the first to quit
04/06/2021, 09:53 - James Kemp: The second quit a month ago
04/06/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: The third has just handed her notice in
04/06/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
04/06/2021, 09:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Trendsetter
04/06/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: It was only a matter of time for all of us
04/06/2021, 09:56 - +44 7752 359588: Amazing
04/06/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: Just so delightful to watch it burn
04/06/2021, 09:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Do you think they've realised they're in the wrong yet?
04/06/2021, 09:57 - James Kemp: Oh definitely not
04/06/2021, 09:57 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs a really weird stubborn pride they all seem to have
04/06/2021, 09:58 - James Kemp: The girl I managed has been offered ¬£40k for a job elsewhere, she told them and they said they‚Äôd take her up to ¬£33k to stay. She said ¬£35k and they have a deal. They said no.
04/06/2021, 09:58 - James Kemp: (They‚Äôve just won a ¬£400k project)
04/06/2021, 09:59 - James Kemp: And this girl has been there years and is amazing
04/06/2021, 09:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Offering her 7 grand less is not even a joke, just insulting
04/06/2021, 09:59 - James Kemp: They‚Äôre losing her over ¬£2k
04/06/2021, 10:37 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm finally meeting my new colleagues face to face this evening
04/06/2021, 10:38 - Reuben Yarwood: It's a big pub booking so hoping they have rain cover...
04/06/2021, 10:39 - Reuben Yarwood: I think the only surprise will be finding out how tall everyone is
04/06/2021, 11:08 - +44 7752 359588: Imagine you tower over them all
04/06/2021, 11:08 - +44 7752 359588: Which pub you hitting?
04/06/2021, 11:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Duke of Sussex, Waterloo
04/06/2021, 11:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Which would be a bit of a mission from Stokey but I'm a southerner for one week only so pretty handy

04/06/2021, 11:24 - Sam Lea: George, your b'n'b isn't called the Chatsworth House Hotel, is it?!
04/06/2021, 11:24 - Sam Lea: (I guess the clue's in the name...)
04/06/2021, 11:25 - +44 7462 872590: No, it's called Glyntwrog House
04/06/2021, 11:26 - James Kemp: Omg such great google reviews!

04/06/2021, 16:40 - Aaron Ayling: I think Sam just rated George 0.1 stars

04/06/2021, 19:46 - +44 7752 359588: Straight porn

04/06/2021, 19:46 - +44 7752 359588: Basically my point was the blonde looks like a fake porn milf

16/06/2021, 12:15 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah, we're one of the favourites (France are the actual favourites). We have a better team than we did in the 2018 world cup. Still a young team.
16/06/2021, 12:15 - Aaron Ayling: We looked very good for the first 15 minutes of our game the other day to my untrained eye

04/07/2021, 10:49 - +44 7462 872590: Will be interesting to see what happens after the Euros, as I assume Gareth Southgate will become Prime Minister relatively soon.
04/07/2021, 13:44 - Sam Lea: One feels this is probably as far as we go, alas
04/07/2021, 13:44 - Sam Lea: Feisty bunch of boys, this Danish team
04/07/2021, 14:30 - Aaron Ayling: Please hand in your (blue) passport on your way out the door for not B E L I E V I N G enough
04/07/2021, 14:32 - Sam Lea: üá∫üá∏ Happy The Fourth Day of July üá∫üá∏
04/07/2021, 14:33 - Sam Lea: Doing any American-style things to celebrate?
04/07/2021, 14:34 - Aaron Ayling: Liz wants to watch National Treasure
04/07/2021, 14:35 - +44 7752 359588: It is the most appropriate celebration
04/07/2021, 14:35 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
05/07/2021, 07:17 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
05/07/2021, 09:12 - James Kemp: Ooh girl I can‚Äôt decide if this looks great or hell?
05/07/2021, 09:13 - James Kemp: Is it a zen dream or a claustrophobic nightmare?
05/07/2021, 09:20 - +61 474 759 280: Loved it!
05/07/2021, 09:21 - +61 474 759 280: Took me about 2 minutes to get out at the end of it but very much enjoyed it
05/07/2021, 09:21 - James Kemp: I think I‚Äôd need a button that could open it whenever in order to not freak out?
05/07/2021, 09:21 - James Kemp: The thought of being stuck in there is my HELL
05/07/2021, 09:22 - +61 474 759 280: Reckon Aaron would love being the meditative guru he is
05/07/2021, 09:22 - +61 474 759 280: Love it being the**
05/07/2021, 09:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah I don't think I could enjoy this either
05/07/2021, 09:48 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah I'd like to try one of those for sure
05/07/2021, 09:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Is the blue light calming?
05/07/2021, 09:51 - +61 474 759 280: Did it for free on a class pass trial
05/07/2021, 09:51 - +61 474 759 280: Oh you turn off the lights once you‚Äôre in
05/07/2021, 09:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh wow.
05/07/2021, 09:52 - Reuben Yarwood: Not sure I want to be that alone with my thoughts
05/07/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd just need a panic button
05/07/2021, 09:52 - +61 474 759 280: The water is salted so you just float. Water‚Äôs at your body temperature so it doesn‚Äôt feel hot or cold
05/07/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: Rather than some person being like ‚Äúback in an hour‚Äù
05/07/2021, 09:52 - +61 474 759 280: There was one!!
05/07/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: In that case, fine!
05/07/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: Load up the bong and get right in
05/07/2021, 09:53 - +61 474 759 280: I almost hit it when I couldn‚Äôt get out lol
05/07/2021, 09:53 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah I would hit the panic button as they shut the lid
05/07/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: I just need to know I can gtfo then I‚Äôm fine
05/07/2021, 09:55 - Reuben Yarwood: @61474759280 You reckon you'll do it again?
05/07/2021, 09:55 - +61 474 759 280: It sorted my back pain right out
05/07/2021, 09:56 - +61 474 759 280: So potentially!
05/07/2021, 09:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice!
05/07/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: I love that
05/07/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: IT HEALED ME FULLY
05/07/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: Might do it again
05/07/2021, 09:56 - James Kemp: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
05/07/2021, 09:56 - +61 474 759 280: I think I‚Äôll get more out of it the second time too, was a bit on edge for the first twenty minutes haha
05/07/2021, 10:06 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah this sounds terrifying
05/07/2021, 10:07 - James Kemp: How‚Äôs the hol going, guys??
05/07/2021, 10:07 - James Kemp: What‚Äôs your Airbnb sitch like?
05/07/2021, 10:13 - +44 7752 359588: We're on the train back now!
05/07/2021, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: It was good tho! Rudely the weather is quite nice today, but we mostly avoided the rain all weekend
05/07/2021, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: Airbnb was just a sort of small cottage thing off the high street
05/07/2021, 10:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds cosy!
05/07/2021, 10:15 - Aaron Ayling: I HAVE TRANSCENDED TO THE ULTIMATE PLANE OF EXISTENCE 6/10
05/07/2021, 10:16 - +61 474 759 280: I think you‚Äôre missing the point
05/07/2021, 10:16 - +61 474 759 280: My back is FIXED
05/07/2021, 10:16 - +61 474 759 280: Why return?
05/07/2021, 10:17 - Aaron Ayling: Chiropractors HATE him with this one simple trick
05/07/2021, 10:17 - +61 474 759 280: üòÇ
05/07/2021, 10:18 - James Kemp: @447940330084
05/07/2021, 11:07 - Sam Lea: Did you have some whale sounds or similar playing inside? Or just... [silence] / the sound of your own sloshing
05/07/2021, 11:20 - +61 474 759 280: First and last 5 minutes had the whale noises
05/07/2021, 12:54 - James Kemp: How tempted were you to crack one out
05/07/2021, 12:55 - James Kemp: And did the addition of whale noises change that answer?
05/07/2021, 13:11 - +61 474 759 280: Hahah not at all. I think the floating would have added an additional challenge practically speaking too
05/07/2021, 20:31 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
05/07/2021, 20:36 - Sam Lea: lovely bit of longform propaganda from thundercat
05/07/2021, 20:40 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha what
05/07/2021, 20:40 - +44 7752 359588: Is this on actual tv?
05/07/2021, 20:52 - Sam Lea: Channel 5, baybeee
05/07/2021, 21:21 - Aaron Ayling: Liz loves a channel 5 trash docco - see also 24 hours in Paddington and the one about Iceland
05/07/2021, 23:06 - +61 474 759 280: https://twitter.com/BeardedGenius/status/1411957065489260544?s=20
05/07/2021, 23:10 - James Kemp: I am being unapologetic about my lack of time for football chat amidst all the heteros at work - actually to the extent of pretending I hate it more than I do as an FU to their straightness
05/07/2021, 23:10 - James Kemp: üòè
05/07/2021, 23:11 - James Kemp: Also am sure this is news to nobody, but Dani and I just brought our second dose appointments forward by 3 weeks each just by going on the NHS website and managing appointments!
05/07/2021, 23:14 - Sam Lea: Was it relatively straightforward? Have been meaning to look into this
05/07/2021, 23:14 - James Kemp: Completely! Just needed NHS no and a booking ref
05/07/2021, 23:14 - James Kemp: Which was on my last confirmation text
05/07/2021, 23:14 - Sam Lea: Great news! So, baccanalian festival of debauchery in... c. 4/5 weeks?
05/07/2021, 23:15 - James Kemp: Shots of saliva all round!
05/07/2021, 23:15 - Sam Lea: ü§§
06/07/2021, 00:39 - +61 474 759 280: Who‚Äôs keen lmao?
https://australianaviation.com.au/2021/07/one-way-london-sydney-flights-hit-43000/
06/07/2021, 07:29 - +44 7752 359588: Yes managed to move mine up too!
06/07/2021, 07:30 - +44 7752 359588: Holy shit who even is buying these
06/07/2021, 07:48 - +61 474 759 280: We are once again a prison island
06/07/2021, 07:48 - +61 474 759 280: They think we might open up again in late 2022 but no promises
06/07/2021, 07:49 - +61 474 759 280: We are 7% vaccinated üôÉ
06/07/2021, 08:21 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
06/07/2021, 08:23 - +44 7752 359588: Crazy vaccine rollout is so slow
06/07/2021, 08:24 - +44 7752 359588: Will send cigarettes for you to trade as currency
06/07/2021, 08:24 - +61 474 759 280: We went all in on AstraZeneca
06/07/2021, 08:24 - Aaron Ayling: But on the flip side its amazing how well Controlled it has been up to this point considering the low vaccine rate
06/07/2021, 08:24 - +61 474 759 280: Then our health advisory panel ruled it unsuitable for anyone over 50 lol
06/07/2021, 08:24 - +61 474 759 280: Under 50*
06/07/2021, 08:25 - Aaron Ayling: AZ or any vaccine at all?
06/07/2021, 08:25 - +61 474 759 280: AZ
06/07/2021, 08:25 - Aaron Ayling: I guess Oz got amazing first half of pandemic, shit second half
06/07/2021, 08:25 - +61 474 759 280: YEP
06/07/2021, 08:26 - +61 474 759 280: Basically if the answer to the problem is hard borders we got this shit
06/07/2021, 08:26 - +61 474 759 280: But if it‚Äôs _anything else_ we really don‚Äôt
06/07/2021, 08:32 - Aaron Ayling: Under 30s aren't getting AZ here, but I don't think I know anyone around that got AZ at all regardless of age
06/07/2021, 08:34 - +61 474 759 280: Over 60* rather
06/07/2021, 08:34 - +61 474 759 280: Under 60*
06/07/2021, 08:35 - +44 7752 359588: This is bonkers
06/07/2021, 08:35 - +44 7752 359588: Are they just swimming in extra az now?
06/07/2021, 08:35 - +44 7752 359588: Also like the risk of blood clot is higher from lots of types of birth control
06/07/2021, 08:36 - +61 474 759 280: Then on top of that the PM went rogue last week and said despite what the chief health officers are warning against, anyone can get AZ now
06/07/2021, 08:36 - +61 474 759 280: So you can get AZ and I will later this month. But because of all the confusion no one wants it now
06/07/2021, 08:40 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh that's also spicy
06/07/2021, 08:40 - Aaron Ayling: I would 100% do the same
06/07/2021, 08:40 - Aaron Ayling: As in get AZ
06/07/2021, 08:42 - +61 474 759 280: They also fucked up earlier this year when they were vaccinating health care professionals by switching from AZ to Pfizer midway through
06/07/2021, 08:42 - +61 474 759 280: And basically said ‚Äúsorry Pfizer‚Äôs better, our bad!‚Äù
06/07/2021, 08:44 - +61 474 759 280: Like it does make sense because Pfizer is slightly better at mitigating transmission, and that‚Äôs important when dealing with at risk communities, but it looked awful
06/07/2021, 08:46 - Reuben Yarwood: With this and the blood clot thing I imagine no one wants AZ at all
06/07/2021, 08:47 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah basically
06/07/2021, 08:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Which is madness as it's almost as good and way way cheaper
06/07/2021, 08:47 - Reuben Yarwood: And you've got loads!
06/07/2021, 08:48 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
06/07/2021, 09:12 - James Kemp: RIP Aus
06/07/2021, 09:35 - James Kemp: How‚Äôre your vacc 2 side effects, @447912940213??
06/07/2021, 09:36 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm scared because they‚Äôre often reported as worse than the first and I was ready to have my arm amputated after round 1! üôà
06/07/2021, 10:29 - Aaron Ayling: So arm pain wise - fine! Hurt a bit but I think slightly less than the first time.

At +12 hours I felt slightly hungover, tehn at +24 hours felt significantly weaker and drained. at +27 hours I was wiped the fuck out - super nauseous and could barely stand up, got flu like shivers etc. But then I slept it off and was fine the next day!
06/07/2021, 10:29 - Aaron Ayling: Anecdotally the second one is worse, but I think Sofia was completely fine after her second.
06/07/2021, 10:30 - +44 7462 872590: I've got my second dose tonight, will let you know how it goes.
06/07/2021, 10:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds pretty rough Aaron but glad you're on the other side. Conversely we got my grandad his second AZ one a couple of weeks ago. He's 84 and just had cancer and he was totally fine
06/07/2021, 10:38 - Aaron Ayling: Also accorsing to Sofia there's a walk-in vacc centre in bounds green that will give you your second dose at any point 4 weeks after your first - that's how she got her second a bit qiocker (she's working on tight timelines around going to sweden for her sister's wedding)
06/07/2021, 11:08 - James Kemp: Oof rough!!
06/07/2021, 11:08 - James Kemp: Glad you‚Äôre through it, aye
06/07/2021, 11:33 - Aaron Ayling: Was fine once I'd slept it off though - all in all don't think I got it too bad!
07/07/2021, 04:06 - +61 474 759 280: Despite all the obstacles I was listing yesterday I‚Äôm now on my way to get Pfizer lol
07/07/2021, 04:07 - +61 474 759 280: Turns out I‚Äôm eligible for it through my volunteering at the dining hall
07/07/2021, 04:25 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 07:20 - +44 7752 359588: Wooo congrats!!!
07/07/2021, 08:39 - Aaron Ayling: Nice!
07/07/2021, 08:39 - +61 474 759 280: Universe got tired of my bitching obviously
07/07/2021, 08:40 - Aaron Ayling: So as much as it was purported that we were going to have a kind of "privileged class" of vaccinated people that were allowed to do stuff, that's not really happening due to the quick uptake of the vaccine and the govt's general dgafness
07/07/2021, 08:40 - Aaron Ayling: Do you think that it will happen in Oz though?
07/07/2021, 08:41 - Aaron Ayling: Just due to the slow rollout etc
07/07/2021, 08:41 - +61 474 759 280: I think we might get that actually üò¨
07/07/2021, 08:46 - +44 7462 872590: Nice!!!
07/07/2021, 09:35 - James Kemp: Great news!!
07/07/2021, 09:35 - James Kemp: Also why does she have a nickname? Corminarty whut?
07/07/2021, 09:36 - +61 474 759 280: Uuuuh don‚Äôt know actually
07/07/2021, 09:36 - Sam Lea: Cleopatra
07/07/2021, 09:36 - Sam Lea: Cominarty(a)
07/07/2021, 09:36 - James Kemp: Ohhhh I just googled
07/07/2021, 09:37 - James Kemp: Corminarty actually means cyanide
07/07/2021, 09:37 - James Kemp: U got got, sis
07/07/2021, 09:37 - +61 474 759 280: Oh no ü•≤
07/07/2021, 09:37 - Aaron Ayling: good
07/07/2021, 09:39 - Aaron Ayling: It's apparently the brand name for Pfizer's vaccine.
07/07/2021, 09:39 - Aaron Ayling: Lol shit branding noone knows wtf it is
07/07/2021, 09:39 - James Kemp: Also shit brand name?
07/07/2021, 09:39 - Aaron Ayling: lol at the first line of this article from 6 months ago:
07/07/2021, 09:39 - Aaron Ayling: https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/pfizer-biontech-select-comirnaty-as-brand-name-for-covid-19-vaccine
07/07/2021, 09:39 - Aaron Ayling: > Comirnaty. It‚Äôs a name we‚Äôll all know soon.
07/07/2021, 09:40 - Aaron Ayling: "The new brand name for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty mashes up community, immunity, mRNA and COVID"
07/07/2021, 09:40 - Sam Lea: Ty = covid
07/07/2021, 09:40 - James Kemp: I can‚Äôt help but say Pfizer like how the pokemon Scyther used to say its name in the anime
07/07/2021, 09:41 - James Kemp: Sharing this in the hopes you all will now also be afflicted and share my pain
07/07/2021, 09:41 - Aaron Ayling: I say it like this lady says sliders - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgCpI1FzRb4
07/07/2021, 09:41 - Aaron Ayling: at 4 seconds in
07/07/2021, 09:42 - James Kemp: Not a million miles from each other - mine‚Äôs like yours on helium
07/07/2021, 09:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Named like a year 5 science project
07/07/2021, 09:47 - +61 474 759 280: Loooool
07/07/2021, 09:48 - Aaron Ayling: I'd have went with "COVID-B-GONE"
07/07/2021, 09:48 - James Kemp: NO-VID
07/07/2021, 09:48 - James Kemp: üí™üèª
07/07/2021, 09:49 - James Kemp: I feel like this is a blank on the TV blankety blank game we used to play
07/07/2021, 09:49 - James Kemp: Scientists have developed a nee vaccine for COVID and they have called it ______________
07/07/2021, 09:49 - James Kemp: And I‚Äôd end up going base and just writing CUM
07/07/2021, 09:49 - Aaron Ayling: KUNTFLAPPS
07/07/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: Elizabeth Mucha in a cave
07/07/2021, 09:52 - Aaron Ayling: How we all feeling about Denmark tonight lads?
07/07/2021, 09:53 - Aaron Ayling: Consensus seems to be "it'll be tough but we should do it"?
07/07/2021, 09:53 - James Kemp: Hope they‚Äôre fit
07/07/2021, 09:53 - Aaron Ayling: Denmark seems like it'd be a fit country?
07/07/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking
07/07/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: Like the butchest of the scandi countries?
07/07/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: Idk why - maybe because bacon is from there
07/07/2021, 09:55 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
07/07/2021, 10:01 - Sam Lea: Yeah, Denmark make me reasonably nervous. They're riding the crest of an emotional story arc, very spirited bunch of lads. Also their goalie is Peter Schmichael's son (Peter being the famous Fergie-era Man Utd goalie / goalie for the Danish national side the time they won the Euros in 92)
07/07/2021, 10:01 - +44 7462 872590: ü§ûwe can get over the line
07/07/2021, 10:01 - James Kemp: If we lose, we gotta back them as winners surely
07/07/2021, 10:01 - James Kemp: Their story arc would be cum
07/07/2021, 11:07 - James Kemp: In other news, looks like the summer weather is set to return in time for my bday, so we should get to get wasted in a field!! ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚òÄÔ∏è
07/07/2021, 11:09 - +44 7752 359588: üéâüéâüéâüçªü•Çüç∏üçæü§Æ
07/07/2021, 11:09 - +44 7752 359588: I wish there was a clear wasted emoji

07/07/2021, 11:48 - Sam Lea: Theoretical question:
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Sam Lea: How much money would you feel is an acceptable price for you personally to pay, for England to win only their second ever international tournament
07/07/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: ¬£0
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Sam Lea: Haha
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Sam Lea: Fair
07/07/2021, 11:49 - +44 7752 359588: I'd chuck in ¬£1000
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Sam Lea: Woof
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Sam Lea: Now we're talking
07/07/2021, 11:49 - +44 7752 359588: Just to make some people happy
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow
07/07/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: Moneybags!
07/07/2021, 11:49 - Reuben Yarwood: I was going to say a tenner
07/07/2021, 11:50 - +44 7752 359588: Like I feel like that is the happiest I would ever be able to make such a large group of people
07/07/2021, 11:50 - +44 7752 359588: Think I'd feel a bit smug
07/07/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: I just have no interest in these people‚Äôs happiness ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
07/07/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: I ain‚Äôt mad if it comes about naturally!
07/07/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: Be happy!
07/07/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: But cba contributing to it
07/07/2021, 11:50 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, football fans' happiness is probably less important to me
07/07/2021, 11:51 - +44 7752 359588: But hey why not
07/07/2021, 11:51 - +44 7752 359588: Sam I need to know your amount
07/07/2021, 11:52 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs the crux of it for me

07/07/2021, 12:23 - Aaron Ayling: Nothing for the euros. Maybe chuck a tenner for the world Cup?
07/07/2021, 12:30 - James Kemp: Love how hard you balled on this, @447752359588
07/07/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: That's probably the most happiness per dollar I'd ever manage in my life, so if it took 1000 then sure
07/07/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: But hell if I could get it for a tenner even better
07/07/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: Like when else would me spending 1000 make that many people that happy
07/07/2021, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: I think I just like the power trip
07/07/2021, 12:32 - James Kemp: Ten bags a packet for my bday
07/07/2021, 12:33 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe I'm setting myself up to be into findom at some point here
07/07/2021, 12:33 - James Kemp: Smaller numbers but still
07/07/2021, 12:33 - James Kemp: Do it
07/07/2021, 12:33 - +44 7752 359588: Jim's happiness on drugs > thousands of football fans
07/07/2021, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: Higher happiness so it balances out
07/07/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: Now we‚Äôre talking

07/07/2021, 13:53 - Aaron Ayling: But the video of that is great
07/07/2021, 13:53 - Aaron Ayling: The interviewer just doesn't know how to respond
07/07/2021, 13:53 - James Kemp: Also what do they expect by way of an answer
07/07/2021, 13:54 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah it's so Anglo centric

07/07/2021, 14:32 - +61 474 759 280: Ah yes
07/07/2021, 14:33 - +61 474 759 280: Look to be honest at that age I probably didn‚Äôt know either of those places were actual countries

07/07/2021, 20:37 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently so the ball doesn't go below the players feet when they jumo up to stop the kick?
07/07/2021, 20:37 - +44 7752 359588: Aaron told me that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
07/07/2021, 20:38 - James Kemp: This is definitely the tactic Aaron would play in Catan football
07/07/2021, 20:39 - James Kemp: To the rest of our bafflement
07/07/2021, 20:39 - +44 7752 359588: Haaaa
07/07/2021, 20:39 - +44 7752 359588: I guess they expect the ball to go up but you could fake out and go below
07/07/2021, 20:39 - +44 7752 359588: Also: üéâüéâ
07/07/2021, 20:39 - +61 474 759 280: Whoaaa

07/07/2021, 20:40 - James Kemp: Omg we are so far behind
07/07/2021, 20:40 - James Kemp: Heard the reaction outside a minute before it happened
07/07/2021, 20:40 - +44 7752 359588: What are you watching it on?

07/07/2021, 20:47 - James Kemp: Also how did that half have no extra time
07/07/2021, 20:47 - James Kemp: They were stopping and starting err 5 seconds
07/07/2021, 20:50 - Aaron Ayling: Think we just need to settle down a bit at half time and we should have this
07/07/2021, 20:52 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah hopefully
07/07/2021, 20:52 - James Kemp: You think?
07/07/2021, 20:52 - James Kemp: Looks like it could go either way still to me??
07/07/2021, 20:53 - +44 7462 872590: England need to settle early second half and trust we have better players. But yeah Denmark have been very good and can hurt us on the counter. Interesting second half to come.
07/07/2021, 20:53 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm getting drama so I‚Äôm HAPPY

07/07/2021, 21:37 - James Kemp: I loved that rhyming couplet on Grealish: he finds the ball/lures you in/tempts you with a tackle/you cannot win
07/07/2021, 21:37 - Aaron Ayling: This feels like it's going to extra time but they'll be a goal at about the 20 minute mark. Can't decide who's goal that'll be
07/07/2021, 21:37 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I clocked that

07/07/2021, 22:18 - +61 474 759 280: None of the commentators think it was a penalty lol
07/07/2021, 22:18 - James Kemp: 3 lines and some skirt
07/07/2021, 22:18 - James Kemp: LMAO
07/07/2021, 22:18 - James Kemp: I just came up with that you‚Äôre welcome
07/07/2021, 22:20 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah but that free kick that the Danes scored one wasn't a free kick so it balances out üòá
07/07/2021, 22:20 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúI can hardly hear myself think and it‚Äôs fantastic‚Äù

07/07/2021, 22:23 - James Kemp: Stfu, cunts
07/07/2021, 22:25 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah this is gonna be a long 10 mins
07/07/2021, 22:30 - James Kemp: Do you think we would be raging if the penalty had erroneously been given against us and not them?
07/07/2021, 22:30 - James Kemp: Like, would that become the story of the match? Probably?
07/07/2021, 22:31 - +44 7752 359588: Almost certainly
07/07/2021, 22:31 - +44 7752 359588: We are the villains
07/07/2021, 22:31 - Aaron Ayling: Oh yeah 100%
07/07/2021, 22:31 - James Kemp: Sucks to suck!!!!
07/07/2021, 22:34 - Aaron Ayling: These commentators are a lot

07/07/2021, 22:44 - James Kemp: Bit harsh the Danes have to stay on the pitch
07/07/2021, 22:44 - James Kemp: Let the lads go cry
07/07/2021, 22:45 - James Kemp: Also I hate a Sunday final
07/07/2021, 22:45 - James Kemp: Saturday m8
07/07/2021, 22:45 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah should be a Saturday so we can celebrate properly... Or have a day to recover.
07/07/2021, 22:46 - Aaron Ayling: I don't think they had to, just wanted to thank their fans!
07/07/2021, 22:46 - Aaron Ayling: My boss has said if we win we can have a later start
07/07/2021, 22:47 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 22:48 - James Kemp: East Vilage on fire
07/07/2021, 22:49 - Aaron Ayling: Haha Dani looks like he's bracing for an attack from the mob
07/07/2021, 22:49 - Aaron Ayling: The straights are coming
07/07/2021, 23:13 - James Kemp: Still going üò¨
07/07/2021, 23:14 - Aaron Ayling: We can hear a huge ruckus in the distance
08/07/2021, 00:25 - Sam Lea: So
08/07/2021, 00:25 - Sam Lea: The question is
08/07/2021, 00:25 - Sam Lea: ...where to watch The Big Final‚Ñ¢?
08/07/2021, 14:17 - +44 7752 359588: Y'all seen about the laser on the danish goalie's face? England is definitely the villain in this story
08/07/2021, 14:18 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs what the ref was gossinh about at the start of the second half??
08/07/2021, 14:18 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh yeah
08/07/2021, 14:40 - +44 7462 872590: Schmeichel still saved the penalty. Amazing keeper.
08/07/2021, 14:41 - +44 7752 359588: But wasnt that right before the rebound goal? I feel like if this happened to England we would be doggered
08/07/2021, 14:42 - +44 7462 872590: Oh yeah if it happened to England then WAR
08/07/2021, 14:42 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
08/07/2021, 14:43 - +44 7462 872590: I don't think the laser pointer actually made a difference though.
08/07/2021, 14:43 - +44 7462 872590: Still bad form
08/07/2021, 14:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Booing during their national anthem is really shit
08/07/2021, 14:44 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah, they've done it against every team playing at Wembley. Can't believe more hasn't been done before this game
08/07/2021, 14:44 - Sam Lea: tbf most side's fans have been booing each others anthems
08/07/2021, 14:44 - Reuben Yarwood: That's villain behaviour
08/07/2021, 14:45 - Sam Lea: (don't make it k tho)
08/07/2021, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: I mean england is already the villain of Europe, might as well lean into it eh
08/07/2021, 14:47 - Sam Lea: Nothing to lose now
08/07/2021, 14:47 - +44 7462 872590: The commentary is getting very bias. Like I get it England commentary for the England game. But still, they were going on about how much England as a nation deserves this because of the 18 months we gone through... Like no other countries have gone through the same, most of it was self inflicted by our own governments incompetence.
08/07/2021, 14:48 - Sam Lea: Yeah that was some BS
08/07/2021, 14:48 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ true. God can you imagine what we'll be like if we win. I'm a bit scared.
08/07/2021, 14:49 - +44 7462 872590: England European Champions.
08/07/2021, 14:49 - Aaron Ayling: Itv commentary SUCKS
08/07/2021, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I expect full blown rioting
08/07/2021, 14:56 - +44 7462 872590: The final will be broadcast on both BBC and ITV.... Like why? Why on earth would anyone watch it on ITV with adverts.
08/07/2021, 14:58 - +44 7462 872590: On the BBC, the coverage will be fronted by Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, and Jurgen Klinsmann.
08/07/2021, 14:58 - +44 7462 872590: Jurgen!!!!
08/07/2021, 14:59 - +44 7462 872590: Some balance at least
08/07/2021, 15:09 - +44 7462 872590: Where are you guys planning on watching the game, at home or pub? Could get wild!

08/07/2021, 15:12 - James Kemp: Also ITV hub was legit two minutes behind
08/07/2021, 15:13 - James Kemp: Such a frustrating experience hearing the crowds roar outside and then two minutes later seeing the goal
08/07/2021, 15:13 - James Kemp: ü§ûüèª BBC on time for the final
08/07/2021, 15:15 - Aaron Ayling: And possibly more annoying the opposite - knowing to not get excited if there's a big chance but the crowd hasn't gone off
08/07/2021, 15:16 - Aaron Ayling: I think iplayer is usually pretty good at being at the same time
08/07/2021, 15:22 - James Kemp: Exactly

23/07/2021, 11:23 - +61 474 759 280: It is kicking off in Australia at the moment. Sydney has failed in suppressing the virus so the surrounding states are forming a _ring of steel_ around New South Wales
23/07/2021, 11:23 - +61 474 759 280: No one knows what happens now, potentially Sydney will be cut off from the rest of the country until we‚Äôre fully vaccinated
23/07/2021, 11:24 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow, and that could be a while?
23/07/2021, 11:25 - +61 474 759 280: At this rate! We‚Äôre only 11% vaccinated on a national levelI

23/07/2021, 11:26 - +61 474 759 280: Yep!

23/07/2021, 11:32 - +61 474 759 280: The federal govt has fucked everyone
23/07/2021, 11:33 - James Kemp: So you just did so well in wave 1 that they never bothered building any supplies?
23/07/2021, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: Fed is a tory govt and theyre even turning on the NSW govt now which is also tory
23/07/2021, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: Yep
23/07/2021, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: Forgot about covid
23/07/2021, 11:33 - James Kemp: Fine at the time but pretty short sighted in hindsight? Is that what everyone‚Äôs saying?
23/07/2021, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: Just kept the borders shut
23/07/2021, 11:33 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah basically
23/07/2021, 11:34 - +61 474 759 280: Really underestimated delta and figured we didn‚Äôt need to rush
23/07/2021, 11:35 - James Kemp: Is NZ the same?
23/07/2021, 11:36 - +61 474 759 280: Essentially. And now they‚Äôve shut the borders to us.
23/07/2021, 11:36 - +61 474 759 280: We‚Äôve had a travel bubble until now
23/07/2021, 11:37 - James Kemp: Damn, son - so you‚Äôre where we were a year ago but somehow even more fucked? I‚Äôm sorry üò¢

26/07/2021, 07:50 - +44 7752 359588: It makes no sense
26/07/2021, 08:16 - Aaron Ayling: They probably AB tested a few email subjects and get the best hits on a "we're sorry" despite the message being nothing to do with that
26/07/2021, 10:23 - James Kemp: So a fourth Matrix film is coming out this year, eh??

29/07/2021, 11:41 - James Kemp: How much do you lie on your CV?
29/07/2021, 11:42 - James Kemp: The truth hovers around mine, but only sometimes lands
29/07/2021, 11:42 - +44 7752 359588: Mine is very honest
29/07/2021, 11:43 - +44 7752 359588: Probably only exaggeration is just not sharing credit for certain things, but I feel like you don't really do that on cvs
29/07/2021, 11:43 - +44 7752 359588: Like instead of saying contributed to, I would just say organised or managed or something else
29/07/2021, 11:43 - James Kemp: Oh that is my biggest offence for sure
29/07/2021, 11:44 - James Kemp: I say I managed everything
29/07/2021, 11:44 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah pretty much same
29/07/2021, 11:45 - James Kemp: Yeah I am fully taking credit for something I just watched someone else do at Hackney

29/07/2021, 11:46 - +61 474 759 280: Watching counts as doing
29/07/2021, 11:47 - Reuben Yarwood: I guess it's hard to lie on mine because stuff is on imdb and in the credits
29/07/2021, 11:48 - +44 7752 359588: It would be a bold move tho if you just did it
29/07/2021, 11:49 - Reuben Yarwood: "I like this guy's style"
29/07/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: Just claim you directed Avatar

29/07/2021, 11:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Nah, we are already ghosts
29/07/2021, 11:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Locked away in a dark room for months
29/07/2021, 11:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe ghost directing though?
29/07/2021, 11:55 - Reuben Yarwood: John how are you settling into your pad?

29/07/2021, 11:56 - +61 474 759 280: Eventually
29/07/2021, 11:56 - Reuben Yarwood: The true sign of adulthood
29/07/2021, 11:56 - Reuben Yarwood: /having your shit together
29/07/2021, 11:56 - James Kemp: Not true, our living room‚Äôs covered
29/07/2021, 11:57 - +61 474 759 280: Waiting til spring to buy an outdoor table set for the balcony
29/07/2021, 11:57 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs pissing down every day atm
29/07/2021, 11:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Very nice!
29/07/2021, 11:57 - Reuben Yarwood: The exception that proves the rule?
29/07/2021, 11:58 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs how that works?
29/07/2021, 11:58 - James Kemp: ü§Æ
29/07/2021, 11:58 - James Kemp: How much longer you got in lockdown??!
29/07/2021, 11:58 - Reuben Yarwood: I never really understood that expression tbh
29/07/2021, 11:58 - James Kemp: Yeah me neither?
29/07/2021, 11:59 - James Kemp: Feels like something @447912940213 would school us on?
29/07/2021, 12:06 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I do actually know this!
29/07/2021, 12:07 - Aaron Ayling: It's like, if you are told of a specific case (e.g. where something is allowed)  you can infer that in general the opposite is the rule
29/07/2021, 12:07 - Aaron Ayling: So a sign that says "only guide dogs allowed"
29/07/2021, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: The guide dogs are the exception which proves the rule that no dogs are allowed
29/07/2021, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: "Jim is the only mess that has a decorated living room"
29/07/2021, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: Everyone else with a decorated living room is not a mess
29/07/2021, 12:09 - James Kemp: I knew you would know!
29/07/2021, 12:10 - Aaron Ayling: But how Reuben used it before is more like this usage:
29/07/2021, 12:10 - Aaron Ayling: "In many uses of the phrase, however, the existence of an exception is taken to more definitively 'prove' a rule to which the exception does not fit. Under this sense it is "the unusualness of the exception"[2] which proves how prevalent the tendency or rule of thumb to which it runs contrary is. For example: a rural village is "always" quiet. A local farmer rents his fields to a rock festival, which disturbs the quiet. In this example, saying "the exception proves the rule" is in a literal sense incorrect, as the exception shows (first) that the belief is not a rule and (second) there is no 'proof' involved. However, the phrase draws attention to the rarity of the exception, and in so doing establishes the general accuracy of the rule."
29/07/2021, 12:11 - Aaron Ayling: So it's one of those phrases that has shifted it's meaning to kind of mean "that's a rare thing"
29/07/2021, 12:12 - James Kemp: Move over, Susie Dent!

01/08/2021, 09:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Something about the angle makes this look like a litre glass
01/08/2021, 10:12 - +61 474 759 280: Has anyone heard of this Woodstock 99 documentary
01/08/2021, 10:13 - +61 474 759 280: I looked up the set list and it was truly the zenith of the Reuben/Stowellman/Liz favoured music genre

01/08/2021, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: "Oppressive heat‚Äîwhich reached above 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C)‚Äîand difficult environmental conditions marred the festival from early on. Added to this was the fact that the site, a former air strip, lacked many shade trees.[12] The East and West stages were 2.3 miles (3.7 km) apart, forcing festival goers to walk across hot concrete surfaces. There was not enough room on grassy areas for many campers to set up their pup tents, and some resorted to camping on asphalt"
01/08/2021, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds like hell
01/08/2021, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Great lineup though

02/08/2021, 10:48 - +44 7752 359588: Hey all - if you know anyone in the UK who works in science reporting, especially civic science (aka how science intersects with public life) we have this award Civic Science Fellowship at the University of Oregon: http://www.fulbright.org.uk/going-to-the-usa/academic-and-professional/fulbright-scholar-awards/awards-available/civic-science-storytelling
02/08/2021, 10:48 - +44 7752 359588: It's 18 months and the stipend is $120,000 and we basically have no applicants
02/08/2021, 10:48 - +44 7752 359588: So tell your friends and let them get that $$$$$$
02/08/2021, 10:50 - +44 7752 359588: Deadline is August 15 (although wouldn't be totally shocked if it got extended)
02/08/2021, 14:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Hot damn
02/08/2021, 14:43 - +44 7752 359588: It's bonkers
02/08/2021, 14:44 - +44 7752 359588: Reporting is also pretty loose - could be classic journalism, but could certainly also be videos/podcasting etc
02/08/2021, 14:44 - Reuben Yarwood: I could mention it to a guy from uni actually. He did science reporting for the BBC. Not sure he's still in the game but I could send it his way anyway
02/08/2021, 14:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe he'll know someone
02/08/2021, 14:44 - Reuben Yarwood: He makes educational animations now
02/08/2021, 14:44 - +44 7752 359588: It just kills me to leave that money sitting on the table hahaha
02/08/2021, 14:44 - +44 7752 359588: I think this could also fit if they're sciencey!
02/08/2021, 14:45 - +44 7752 359588: It isn't my programme, but figured I'd send it around
02/08/2021, 14:45 - Reuben Yarwood: I'll pass it on!
02/08/2021, 14:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Also what about Matt Shribman?
02/08/2021, 14:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Isn't that his thang?
02/08/2021, 14:54 - +44 7752 359588: Potentially! Feel free to chuck it his way!
02/08/2021, 15:37 - James Kemp: What if we write a scientific report on how $120,000 worth of drugs affects our participation in society??
02/08/2021, 15:37 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I would read that proposal
02/08/2021, 15:50 - Sam Lea: @447752359588 Passed it on to Matthew S., he says he'll pass it on to a few people he knows who it might suit / interest!
02/08/2021, 15:50 - +44 7752 359588: Great!
02/08/2021, 15:50 - +44 7752 359588: I just want people to take our money hahaha
03/08/2021, 07:15 - +61 474 759 280: the Washington Post wrote a feature on Pete Buttigieg‚Äôs partner Chasten and it is the shadiest fucking profile piece I‚Äôve ever read:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/chasten-buttigieg-pete-buttigieg-washington/2021/07/23/e10fd616-e388-11eb-b722-89ea0dde7771_story.html
03/08/2021, 07:15 - +61 474 759 280: Opener:
‚ÄúChasten Buttigieg put on a few pounds during quarantine. So in April, with pandemic restrictions easing and two doses of vaccine safely in his arm, he set about looking for a gym to join in the city where he had relocated after his husband, Pete, became the secretary of transportation.‚Äù
03/08/2021, 07:19 - +61 474 759 280: "I need a job," Chasten says flatly.
Namely, he wants a job that will pose no risk to his husband‚Äôs career while also allowing him to remain true to his passions and personality. Stepping away from teaching middle-school drama has been one of his biggest sacrifices, says Neve, Chasten‚Äôs friend since college. ‚ÄúHe loves to play; he loves theater and improv,‚Äù Neve says. ‚ÄúBringing that to younger kids was an outlet for him.‚Äù
He feels he can‚Äôt go back ‚Äî at least now, and not at the K-12 level. How could he be honest and present in the work of teaching young people, he wonders, knowing that a disgruntled parent could make news by airing their grievances?
03/08/2021, 07:20 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúWhen reporters would ask me questions like ‚ÄòDid you ever imagine this is where you‚Äôd end up?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat prepared you for this?‚Äô part of me felt like they were saying, ‚ÄòPeople like you don‚Äôt really belong here,‚Äô‚Ää‚Äù he writes in the book.

03/08/2021, 15:38 - +44 7752 359588: Poor chasten
03/08/2021, 15:38 - +44 7752 359588: But not really because that's what you get for marrying Pete buttigieg
03/08/2021, 15:39 - +44 7752 359588: Who is the baby girl balloon for

04/08/2021, 12:55 - +44 7752 359588: Unsurprisingly I LOVE Salem

05/08/2021, 12:39 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs the lack of vaccines that‚Äôs the dumb bit, we‚Äôre stuck in 2020
05/08/2021, 12:39 - +61 474 759 280: They think we could 80% vaccinated by Oct/Nov
05/08/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: And then we won‚Äôt be so lockdown trigger happy
05/08/2021, 12:40 - James Kemp: Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to lockdown for an actual solid period of time, I mean?
05/08/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: We basically eliminate the virus in Victoria then it comes back
05/08/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: So we got to 0 but because Sydney‚Äôs out of control we keep getting got

05/08/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: So there‚Äôs this shit dynamic now where Labor states eliminate the virus, only for Sydney to leak it out to us every month or so
05/08/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: If they don‚Äôt lose the next election I fucking give up

10/08/2021, 11:10 - James Kemp: Omg that is definitely the most triggering bit!
10/08/2021, 17:31 - +44 7752 359588: Just went to a dispensary with Jeff - he spent $280 on an oz
10/08/2021, 17:31 - +44 7752 359588: It was so bizarre
10/08/2021, 17:31 - +44 7752 359588: It was basically like an Argos - you order on a tablet and then go to the counter to collect

10/08/2021, 17:39 - +44 7752 359588: Also there were so many clean cut middle aged suburban dudes in their khaki shorts and polos

10/08/2021, 17:44 - +44 7752 359588: And khaki shorts and cargo shorts are not quite the same haha
10/08/2021, 17:46 - James Kemp: I love that the first bitch is like ‚ÄúI found relief for my health condition‚Äù whereas this bitch just went full in hippy dippy queen
10/08/2021, 17:47 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúI discover the plant‚Äù
10/08/2021, 17:48 - +44 7752 359588: They were really wide ranging
10/08/2021, 17:48 - +44 7752 359588: I think the overall vibe was: look, weed is respectable!
10/08/2021, 17:48 - James Kemp: White women do it!!
10/08/2021, 17:49 - Aaron Ayling: The new opiates

11/08/2021, 01:29 - +61 474 759 280: Something really catty about not answering a military hotline
11/08/2021, 01:29 - +61 474 759 280: Doesn‚Äôt matter how far you go in life
11/08/2021, 01:30 - +61 474 759 280: High school drama will always leave you in good stead for what life throws at you
11/08/2021, 01:31 - +44 7752 359588: Definitely don't vote for kim jong un for homecoming king
11/08/2021, 08:53 - Aaron Ayling: Okay guys, don't Google this

11/08/2021, 09:20 - James Kemp: Was Tails in the first one??
11/08/2021, 09:21 - Aaron Ayling: Teaser reveal at the end I think
11/08/2021, 09:21 - James Kemp: He was always my fave in the OG games, but every time they gave him a voice they made him such a little bitch
11/08/2021, 09:21 - Aaron Ayling: Agreed!
11/08/2021, 09:21 - James Kemp: Knuckles was too straight for me
11/08/2021, 09:21 - James Kemp: Proud Tails girl
11/08/2021, 10:15 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
11/08/2021, 10:16 - James Kemp: Us messaging BABE at 4am for more packet ^
11/08/2021, 10:17 - +61 474 759 280: Loooool
11/08/2021, 10:17 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
11/08/2021, 10:22 - Aaron Ayling: This is obviously just a massive typo but I did read a thing about scanners purposely using shit grammar and spelling because the kind of people who'd fall for the initial bait with said mistakes are more likely to go all the way and be fully scammed
11/08/2021, 10:22 - Aaron Ayling: Helps self select idiots and stops the scanners wasting time
11/08/2021, 10:23 - Aaron Ayling: Scammers
11/08/2021, 10:25 - James Kemp: You‚Äôve gotta be really _dosed_ to go for this one!
11/08/2021, 10:25 - James Kemp: The ideal target, I guess!
11/08/2021, 11:26 - James Kemp: I watched none of the Olympics, but did y‚Äôall see this?!
11/08/2021, 11:26 - James Kemp: https://youtu.be/F_ynPS7YuXk
11/08/2021, 11:34 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah saw that. No exactly the Olympic spirit
11/08/2021, 11:34 - +44 7462 872590: *not
11/08/2021, 11:42 - James Kemp: Outrageous!!
11/08/2021, 11:45 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah there's something very Tory party sports day about it.
11/08/2021, 11:48 - Aaron Ayling: I thi k watching it slowed down kind of makes me think it wasn't on purpose?
11/08/2021, 11:48 - James Kemp: But he skittles so many and then precisely manages to get the last one??
11/08/2021, 11:49 - James Kemp: Vote on your phones now
11/08/2021, 11:49 - Aaron Ayling: Could be a "ahhh I'm fucking up, okay focus on grabbing the last one" split second moment
11/08/2021, 11:49 - Aaron Ayling: He's also leaning over way too much, think he was off balance and fatigued after 19 miles
11/08/2021, 11:50 - James Kemp: Forgiving Frieda
11/08/2021, 11:51 - Aaron Ayling: And those water bottles are so tightly packed together, it would be hard to cleanly grab one while running
11/08/2021, 11:51 - James Kemp: I think he‚Äôs a mean troll
11/08/2021, 11:51 - Aaron Ayling: I just think you know you're on camera, you're not gonna get away with it hence my tendency to think it was an accident
11/08/2021, 11:52 - James Kemp: But his hand doesn‚Äôt even try and close until the end? He‚Äôs open palmed until that point?!
11/08/2021, 11:52 - James Kemp: You are a kinder soul than I
11/08/2021, 11:53 - Aaron Ayling: But he's leaving the row behind it intact - what's his goal?
11/08/2021, 11:53 - Aaron Ayling: If its to deny water to the people behind him he's not done that
11/08/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: To stop a lot of bitches behind him from getting water
11/08/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: He‚Äôs denied 50% of them
11/08/2021, 11:53 - James Kemp: Better than 0
11/08/2021, 11:54 - James Kemp: I admit if he‚Äôd jumped on the table and knocked them all off, that would‚Äôve been more fabulous
11/08/2021, 11:54 - Aaron Ayling: Haha fair. I personally think it was a mistake. He's running at 12 miles per hour and this was over an hour into it and he's off balance trying to not hit the people in front of him.
11/08/2021, 11:54 - James Kemp: And one row is within the realms of deniability
11/08/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: I think he‚Äôs a TREWL
11/08/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: Look at us respectfully disagreeing ü•∏
11/08/2021, 11:55 - James Kemp: We did the internet well
11/08/2021, 11:56 - Aaron Ayling: To this point, yes it does - watch the slow mo about halfway through the row of water he's trying to grab one.
11/08/2021, 11:56 - James Kemp: We could go back and forth all day, I see troll
11/08/2021, 11:57 - James Kemp: That clench comes way too late in the run
11/08/2021, 11:57 - James Kemp: If he were clenching at the beginning, fine
11/08/2021, 11:57 - James Kemp: Also I actually have work to do now! XO
11/08/2021, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: I choose to believe this is petty and on purpose because the thought delights me
11/08/2021, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: ALSO SAM
11/08/2021, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: How does your brain work

11/08/2021, 14:44 - +44 7752 359588: Getting a drive thru covid test and going to the posh mall
11/08/2021, 14:45 - +44 7752 359588: Living my best us life
11/08/2021, 23:34 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
11/08/2021, 23:34 - +44 7752 359588: It's a mega toilet roll
11/08/2021, 23:34 - +44 7752 359588: Meant to last 1 month
11/08/2021, 23:34 - +44 7752 359588: You hace to buy the special holder toi
12/08/2021, 08:48 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
12/08/2021, 08:49 - +44 7462 872590: Anime Stowellman
12/08/2021, 08:53 - Aaron Ayling: Man you look so of the era
12/08/2021, 08:55 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah Aaron I think we both had exactly that hair in 2006 too
12/08/2021, 08:55 - Aaron Ayling: Oh 100%
12/08/2021, 08:55 - +61 474 759 280: We should all do it now
12/08/2021, 10:34 - +61 474 759 280: The weirdest thing about living on my own is that I know a exactly how much butter and milk I‚Äôve consumed since I moved in
12/08/2021, 10:35 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôve knocked off two sticks of butter since end of May
12/08/2021, 10:35 - Aaron Ayling: Man we go through so much fucking butter but it's all Liz baking
12/08/2021, 10:36 - Aaron Ayling: Not complaining as it does mean i end up with tasty treats
12/08/2021, 10:40 - Aaron Ayling: Actually I use a chunk for cooking too
12/08/2021, 10:49 - Reuben Yarwood: I usually cook with butter/oil combo
12/08/2021, 10:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Extra butter = extra tasty
12/08/2021, 10:50 - Reuben Yarwood: We probably get through one a week here!
12/08/2021, 10:51 - +61 474 759 280: How‚Äôs your flat search boiz?
12/08/2021, 10:52 - +61 474 759 280: Pics or stfu

12/08/2021, 10:53 - +61 474 759 280: Just keen for an update
12/08/2021, 11:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Bit stalled at the moment. Got sick of setting up viewings on trips down and someone snapping them up
12/08/2021, 11:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Before I could see them
12/08/2021, 11:06 - +61 474 759 280: Gag
12/08/2021, 11:07 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm planning on moving in with Ella at the start of September
12/08/2021, 11:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Using that as a base to find somewhere
12/08/2021, 11:07 - Reuben Yarwood: I think you have to be in the mix to find a decent place
12/08/2021, 11:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Like finding one from Macc is tricky, never mind Snowdonia!
12/08/2021, 11:09 - +44 7462 872590: üòé
12/08/2021, 11:11 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah hopefully can get down soonish.
12/08/2021, 11:11 - +44 7462 872590: What's the vibe like in London at the moment?
12/08/2021, 11:23 - James Kemp: I think a lot of people have just switched directly to FREEDOM
12/08/2021, 11:23 - James Kemp: Which is a bit stressful?!
12/08/2021, 11:24 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah almost no one up here is wearing a mask now
12/08/2021, 11:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Like a few older people and millennials at the shops but almost no one in pubs etc
12/08/2021, 11:25 - James Kemp: Oh all the pubs round here are fully popping again
12/08/2021, 11:26 - James Kemp: Hackney Wick was a seshy warzone on Sat
12/08/2021, 11:28 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah same here really.
12/08/2021, 11:31 - Reuben Yarwood: The minority of older people who for some reason don't want to or can't get vaccinated are basically going to have to become a recluse now
12/08/2021, 11:31 - Reuben Yarwood: /vulnerable people
12/08/2021, 13:39 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
12/08/2021, 13:59 - +44 7752 359588: Don't know if you've been following anything about the governor of new York resigning because of sexual harassment allegations, but he deffo tried to blame it on "being Italian" which has had be laughing all morning
12/08/2021, 13:59 - +61 474 759 280: I have and I‚Äôve loved it
12/08/2021, 13:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Lol
12/08/2021, 13:59 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm just picturing that expression
12/08/2021, 14:00 - Reuben Yarwood: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/08/2021, 14:00 - James Kemp: Why are Italians obssessed with doing this?!
12/08/2021, 14:00 - +61 474 759 280: I think he might be nosferatu
12/08/2021, 14:00 - James Kemp: (Remembering the 90 day fianc√© firmer friend @447752359588)
12/08/2021, 14:00 - Aaron Ayling: I know the exact data point you're thinking of haha

12/08/2021, 14:01 - James Kemp: Ahahaha
12/08/2021, 14:01 - +44 7752 359588: Bahahaha yessss
12/08/2021, 14:01 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair the question is why are Italian Americans obsessed with doing this
12/08/2021, 14:01 - +44 7752 359588: I think actual Italians are probably less terrible
12/08/2021, 14:01 - +44 7752 359588: (the only time you will hear my say this)
12/08/2021, 14:23 - James Kemp: See of his two European motherlands, Dani has much more affinity for Italy
12/08/2021, 14:23 - James Kemp: Whereas Spain feels way more a vibe
12/08/2021, 14:23 - James Kemp: (Mainly because he‚Äôs Spanish speaking and Italy is therefore more alluring)
12/08/2021, 14:24 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd much rather siesta and vibe in Spain?!
12/08/2021, 14:26 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah same
12/08/2021, 14:43 - +44 7752 359588: Italian food tho

12/08/2021, 14:49 - +44 7752 359588: Controversially I think eggs are my number 1?
12/08/2021, 14:49 - +44 7752 359588: Just doesn't feel like a savory breakfast without
12/08/2021, 14:50 - James Kemp: top voted comment on the post is exactly that
12/08/2021, 14:50 - James Kemp: i think the percentages reflect my tastes pretty well
12/08/2021, 14:50 - James Kemp: fried bread at 47% can fuck off tho
12/08/2021, 14:51 - James Kemp: i'd also elevate a hash brown

16/08/2021, 17:27 - Reuben Yarwood: I only know Iowa from the Slipknot album so this fits my image of a post apocalyptic wasteland
16/08/2021, 17:29 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I do think it's a bit of a food desert
16/08/2021, 17:29 - +44 7752 359588: But also we can get to dubuque in like 20 minutes

17/08/2021, 19:13 - Reuben Yarwood: This looks like the kid drink we always used to have at pubs while the adults were getting pissed - blackcurrant cordial
17/08/2021, 19:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Is it alcoholic?

17/08/2021, 19:45 - +44 7752 359588: There's also a pickle Rick fried pickle dish
17/08/2021, 19:46 - +44 7752 359588: But we are in Iowa, so Rick and Morty is probably edgy
17/08/2021, 19:52 - James Kemp: I feel like if you like Rick and Morty and you‚Äôre Republican, you‚Äôre not quite getting it? ü§î

24/08/2021, 09:57 - +61 474 759 280: Terry towel in South Australia feels like something a Brit or American would make up and say is Australian
24/08/2021, 09:57 - Aaron Ayling: I'll allow Terry towel just for how Australian that sounds
24/08/2021, 09:57 - Aaron Ayling: Hahaha exactly
24/08/2021, 10:03 - Sam Lea: So in that yellow bit of NSW, someone could come out the shower asking you to throw them a towel, you could throw them a tea towel, and that'd be okay, would it?
24/08/2021, 10:03 - Sam Lea: Asking for trouble, that...
24/08/2021, 10:05 - +61 474 759 280: See I feel that for pants as underwear
24/08/2021, 10:06 - +61 474 759 280: Or is pants just underwear?
24/08/2021, 10:06 - +61 474 759 280: 4 years in country, never got to the bottom of this
24/08/2021, 10:06 - Aaron Ayling: Pants is only underwear here

24/08/2021, 15:26 - +44 7752 359588: Might be akin to a Terry towel actually
24/08/2021, 15:29 - James Kemp: You get the longer, thinner ones on bars
24/08/2021, 15:30 - James Kemp: But I am more than happy to adopt this as my new term

24/08/2021, 15:35 - Reuben Yarwood: You are not the One Terry Towel
24/08/2021, 15:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Has anyone seen Always Be My Maybe? That was peak Keanu Reeves for me

24/08/2021, 15:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Yes! Actually a banger
24/08/2021, 15:53 - James Kemp: No, but I saw that there was some Reddit discussion about A Scanner Darkly yesterday
24/08/2021, 15:53 - James Kemp: Tootable Keanu from me!!
24/08/2021, 15:57 - Reuben Yarwood: Tried to watch it once and didn't feel stoned enough
24/08/2021, 15:58 - James Kemp: I think it massively benefits from reading the book first, if you haven‚Äôt?
24/08/2021, 15:58 - James Kemp: I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve understood shit, had I not
24/08/2021, 15:59 - James Kemp: (Can‚Äôt remember if you‚Äôve swallowed that Dick)
24/08/2021, 15:59 - Aaron Ayling: I hadn't read the book and got what was going on fine! Really liked it
24/08/2021, 16:00 - James Kemp: Shhhh
24/08/2021, 16:00 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm not as quick at picking up trippy tings

25/08/2021, 14:18 - James Kemp: See also interviews with him a couple years ago saying how many doors it had opened
25/08/2021, 14:20 - James Kemp: And he‚Äôs also recreated it a load of times himself since?
25/08/2021, 14:20 - James Kemp: I feel like if I were the prosecution, I‚Äôd get straight on that
25/08/2021, 14:21 - James Kemp: Or the defendant, rather
25/08/2021, 14:27 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm a bit confused and I don‚Äôt care enough to look into it, but shouldn‚Äôt he be suing his parents/legal guardian who signed him up for it?
25/08/2021, 14:28 - +61 474 759 280: Presumably Curt didn‚Äôt kidnap him off the street and have a private shoot
25/08/2021, 14:28 - James Kemp: Yeah it seems like opportunistic bullshit to me
25/08/2021, 14:28 - +61 474 759 280: Although if he _did_ then I am in Nirvana baby‚Äôs corner

03/09/2021, 09:13 - Sam Lea: It's slightly peculiar... Why not just tour live, guys
03/09/2021, 09:14 - Sam Lea: Sure, you're all in your 70s, but surely infinitely less hassle than getting hundreds of 3D animators trying to recreate a not-very-convincing version of yourselves in your 30s

14/09/2021, 16:38 - +44 7752 359588: I think by 'more' he might mean at all
14/09/2021, 16:38 - +44 7752 359588: Also he studied in Sheffield, which is probably like 30 years behind London, I assume

16/09/2021, 12:11 - Aaron Ayling: Still something to be said for not having the nagging feeling of needing to appear present /responsive online though
16/09/2021, 12:12 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah same. Taking tomorrow off just because.

09/10/2021, 20:11 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs so camp!
11/10/2021, 13:35 - +44 7752 359588: Boring work chat alert: where do you guys leave your sponges? In the sink? On the side?
11/10/2021, 13:36 - +44 7752 359588: People at work just leave it in the sink, which I find super gross, especially in a shared environment
11/10/2021, 13:36 - +44 7752 359588: But then I might be the crazy one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11/10/2021, 13:37 - James Kemp: In the little sponge dish?!
11/10/2021, 13:37 - James Kemp: Or I just don‚Äôt use it and put my dirty shit in the dishwasher
11/10/2021, 13:37 - James Kemp: (Or leave my dirty shit in the sink if I think I can get away with it)
11/10/2021, 13:39 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe I should just pass ag buy us a sponge dish
11/10/2021, 13:39 - +44 7752 359588: Although to be fair I also do not touch the sponge at all
11/10/2021, 13:39 - +44 7752 359588: WE ARE LIVING IN A PANDEMIC
11/10/2021, 13:40 - +44 7752 359588: But I remain baffled by sponge in the sink
11/10/2021, 13:40 - James Kemp: See I‚Äôm done by this point
11/10/2021, 13:40 - +44 7752 359588: IT JUST SOAKS UP ALL THE DIRTY WATER AND COFFEE DREGS
11/10/2021, 13:40 - James Kemp: Honestly dgaf anymore
11/10/2021, 13:40 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd lick your COVID ass if you asked me to
11/10/2021, 13:41 - +44 7752 359588: I'll bear that in mind üòò
11/10/2021, 13:41 - James Kemp: üçë
12/10/2021, 02:33 - +61 474 759 280: Day 1 of new job and the minister we work for has resigned in disgrace
12/10/2021, 04:18 - +61 474 759 280: He was fingered in an inquiry for stacking branches with fake party members to win seats
12/10/2021, 04:18 - +61 474 759 280: Other than that new job going well!
12/10/2021, 07:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Stacking branches??
12/10/2021, 07:28 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs when you artificially buy votes in your party branches to get nominated to run for office
12/10/2021, 07:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Pretty spicy first day then!
12/10/2021, 08:22 - Aaron Ayling: Haha oh damn
12/10/2021, 08:22 - Aaron Ayling: Glad it's going well otherwise though!
12/10/2021, 09:15 - +44 7462 872590: Crazy! Sounds kinky. Other than that how's the job?
12/10/2021, 09:18 - +44 7752 359588: This feels very the thick of it
12/10/2021, 12:17 - +61 474 759 280: Yep! My first ever (actual) 9-5 job
12/10/2021, 12:18 - +61 474 759 280: So loving that element
12/10/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: I thought you meant literally fingered at first
12/10/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: Was disappointed you Sydney
12/10/2021, 12:18 - James Kemp: Didn‚Äôt
12/10/2021, 12:20 - +61 474 759 280: Getting fingered in an inquiry, like he‚Äôs getting busy in the back row in the room
12/10/2021, 12:20 - +61 474 759 280: And has to resign as a result of that
12/10/2021, 13:57 - Reuben Yarwood: One of my colleagues is working in Paddington today and apparently there is a guy standing outside Paddington station wearing a sandwich board saying "I cheated on my girlfriend on Thursday, this is my punishment"
12/10/2021, 13:57 - Reuben Yarwood: He's been there all day
12/10/2021, 13:58 - Reuben Yarwood: Effective punishment? I can't see it fixing the relationship to be honest
12/10/2021, 14:14 - James Kemp: MESS
12/10/2021, 14:31 - Sam Lea: That'll set him straight I'm sure
12/10/2021, 14:34 - Aaron Ayling: It's only acceptable if she then just dumps him as soon as he gets home
12/10/2021, 14:34 - Aaron Ayling: "lol jk"
12/10/2021, 14:40 - James Kemp: This

12/10/2021, 15:53 - James Kemp: Yeah what
12/10/2021, 15:53 - James Kemp: Definitely viral marketing

12/10/2021, 15:54 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah sounds about right

12/10/2021, 16:23 - Sam Lea: the 'y' in Thursday is the same on all the signs
12/10/2021, 16:24 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
12/10/2021, 16:24 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah it's some viral thing eh
12/10/2021, 16:26 - Aaron Ayling: Or they are all going out with the same girl?
12/10/2021, 16:29 - +44 7462 872590: The guys hooked up with each other
12/10/2021, 16:43 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs gonna end up being part of the logo for whatever new capitalist nightmare this is a part of?
12/10/2021, 16:44 - James Kemp: Also love this theory
12/10/2021, 16:44 - Aaron Ayling: U

13/10/2021, 12:34 - Reuben Yarwood: I hope they didn't find that out after a number 2
13/10/2021, 12:34 - James Kemp: This was my panties when I saw Johnny‚Äôs new lights
13/10/2021, 12:36 - +61 474 759 280: Flushing after the next number 2 is Russian roulette
13/10/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think that was even flushing I think it's just doing that
13/10/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Spicy
13/10/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: Typically this happens the one day Aaron and I are both out
13/10/2021, 12:38 - +44 7752 359588: But it seems to only be impacting the lower floor
13/10/2021, 12:39 - +61 474 759 280: How many days in the office are you now?
13/10/2021, 12:39 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs directed to everyone
13/10/2021, 12:39 - Reuben Yarwood: 0 but 5 as of Nov.
13/10/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: I read Boris Johnson said that younger workers would get gossiped about if they didn‚Äôt come in?
13/10/2021, 12:40 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs meant to be 2 a week but I‚Äôm playing the game
13/10/2021, 12:40 - +61 474 759 280: Like that‚Äôs not what motivates us?
13/10/2021, 12:40 - Aaron Ayling: 2 per month

13/10/2021, 12:42 - +61 474 759 280: Plants take the office over, nature heals

14/10/2021, 16:09 - Aaron Ayling: Oh that's cool!
14/10/2021, 16:10 - James Kemp: The feelings of grossness I have about reviving it are kinda nullified if it‚Äôs doing it on behalf of them?
14/10/2021, 16:10 - James Kemp: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
14/10/2021, 16:10 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah it's like you're being commissioned
14/10/2021, 16:10 - James Kemp: Yeah!
14/10/2021, 16:11 - Aaron Ayling: Like a BBC show or something
14/10/2021, 16:11 - James Kemp: Also way more interesting than my actual job
14/10/2021, 16:11 - Aaron Ayling: Haha yeah, if you can do it on work time that'd be T
14/10/2021, 16:11 - James Kemp: So if I can get paid to do that instead, TOOT
14/10/2021, 16:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Sick! Why you feeling gross about it?
14/10/2021, 16:15 - Aaron Ayling: Have to talk to old people
14/10/2021, 16:17 - James Kemp: Hate fags
14/10/2021, 16:17 - +44 7752 359588: That's exciting!
14/10/2021, 16:17 - James Kemp: I just ended up feeling a bit gross about the whole thing - feels like a pint chat we can have one day üëÑ
14/10/2021, 16:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah deffo

20/10/2021, 12:39 - James Kemp: Who‚Äôs done Squid Game, then?

20/10/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: I hated the last three episodes
20/10/2021, 12:43 - James Kemp: I didn‚Äôt like the last one
20/10/2021, 12:43 - +61 474 759 280: Felt it really eased off the gas
20/10/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: It went from being really fresh it really predictable,
20/10/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: Which in turn surprised me
20/10/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: So there you go
20/10/2021, 12:44 - +61 474 759 280: To*****
20/10/2021, 12:44 - James Kemp: Yeah I hear you
20/10/2021, 12:44 - James Kemp: I guess I had just always imagined that was gonna happen
20/10/2021, 12:45 - James Kemp: It definitely peaks about halfway?
20/10/2021, 12:45 - +61 474 759 280: Yep
20/10/2021, 12:46 - James Kemp: I thought the villain build was good with the final other contestant tho
20/10/2021, 12:46 - James Kemp: How the villainy gradually steps up
20/10/2021, 12:47 - James Kemp: (Not the third act twist, the squid game villain)
20/10/2021, 12:47 - James Kemp: Trying to keep it in enough code for those who haven‚Äôt watched and probably failing
20/10/2021, 12:48 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah agreed
20/10/2021, 12:49 - +61 474 759 280: Old man the North Korean and the main actor delivered their roles so well
20/10/2021, 12:50 - +61 474 759 280: But yeah, i thought it started really strong
20/10/2021, 12:50 - +61 474 759 280: First few episodes are dynamite
20/10/2021, 12:52 - +44 7462 872590: ‚èπÔ∏è‚è∫Ô∏èüîº
20/10/2021, 12:52 - Aaron Ayling: I'm on episode 5 - enjoying it but I think the hype kind of killed it for me
20/10/2021, 12:52 - Aaron Ayling: Like it's Basically the first three Saws, and very tropey. But it's schlocky fun
20/10/2021, 12:53 - James Kemp: Tug of war had me SCREAMING
20/10/2021, 12:53 - Aaron Ayling: A shame to hear it gets worse at the end!
20/10/2021, 12:53 - James Kemp: Again, you know the outcome but easy to just surrender to it
20/10/2021, 12:55 - James Kemp: Is Liz watching it with you?!
20/10/2021, 12:55 - James Kemp: Need to keep my Liz viewing algorithm sharp
20/10/2021, 13:02 - Sam Lea: tbh the biggest impact it's had on me is just to make me crave noodles for the last fortnight  from that one little pensive, rainy shot of him in a noodle bar
20/10/2021, 13:16 - Aaron Ayling: Haha fuck no
20/10/2021, 13:16 - Aaron Ayling: Totally not her thing. Shoved it on during a slow day at work

20/10/2021, 13:34 - James Kemp: You shouldn‚Äôt get got after the game, man
20/10/2021, 13:35 - James Kemp: Scariest bit for me was actually none of the games tho - it was the ‚Äúsurvive the night‚Äù bit
20/10/2021, 13:35 - Sam Lea: I guess game designers going for theatricality
20/10/2021, 13:35 - James Kemp: Girl BYE
20/10/2021, 13:35 - Sam Lea: But very poor design
20/10/2021, 13:36 - Sam Lea: Would *not* have met H&S regulations
20/10/2021, 13:36 - Sam Lea: What would your tactic be
20/10/2021, 13:36 - James Kemp: Kill myself
20/10/2021, 13:37 - James Kemp: Or try and burrow in the furthest corner under a bed
20/10/2021, 13:37 - James Kemp: Basically I am not made to survive that shit
20/10/2021, 13:37 - James Kemp: I am the limping gazelle that gets got first

20/10/2021, 13:53 - +44 7752 359588: Could the corn emoji be better for a dick stand in?
20/10/2021, 14:12 - James Kemp: RIP Aaron

20/10/2021, 15:37 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah the fact they're like 10 meters away from each other doesn't help
20/10/2021, 15:37 - Aaron Ayling: Plus we miss the melodramatic tone of the Korean actors I guess

20/10/2021, 18:40 - James Kemp: I imagine it‚Äôs a lot of yoga, then some meditation, and then looking at the moon and saying shit we wanna give up?

21/10/2021, 11:42 - +44 7752 359588: Poor @447462872590 - constantly sharing his name with pets
21/10/2021, 11:42 - +44 7752 359588: Course John can't resist having George as a roommate
21/10/2021, 11:42 - +44 7462 872590: I love it

21/10/2021, 16:17 - +44 7752 359588: How was the full moon ceremony!?!
21/10/2021, 16:17 - Aaron Ayling: I hope this is the official name of the society
21/10/2021, 16:53 - James Kemp: It was fun! We did that thing where you write things you wanna give up down and burn them
21/10/2021, 16:53 - James Kemp: I wrote all of y‚Äôall names
21/10/2021, 16:59 - +44 7752 359588: It's ok, I know you're addicted to me üòò
21/10/2021, 17:00 - James Kemp: I wish I knew how to quit you!
21/10/2021, 20:52 - +61 474 759 280: What did you actually write? üëÄ

22/10/2021, 09:41 - +44 7752 359588: What joy!
22/10/2021, 09:41 - James Kemp: Some new Czech lager they were promoting
22/10/2021, 09:41 - +44 7752 359588: Lush
22/10/2021, 09:41 - +44 7752 359588: How was the pint
22/10/2021, 09:42 - James Kemp: Delish!
22/10/2021, 09:43 - Sam Lea: well, *_czech_* you out üòèüòèüòéüòéüòé
22/10/2021, 09:43 - Aaron Ayling: How was the meetup? Any decent peeps?
22/10/2021, 09:43 - Sam Lea: (the joke here is that "Czech" sounds like the word "check", despite being spelled differently)
22/10/2021, 09:49 - James Kemp: Ohhhhh shit!
22/10/2021, 09:49 - James Kemp: Thanks for the explainer
22/10/2021, 09:50 - Sam Lea: no worries
22/10/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: Yeah there were some gooduns! One guy is the former Guinness world record holder for the fastest time completing a marathon dressed as a nun
22/10/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: That was my favorite fact of the evening, I think
22/10/2021, 09:50 - Sam Lea: Amazing
22/10/2021, 09:50 - Sam Lea: Did he just decide "right, there's a record that's ripe for the taking"
22/10/2021, 09:50 - James Kemp: There was only 1 rotten queen, but didn‚Äôt let her spoil the bunch
22/10/2021, 09:51 - Sam Lea: Or was he just _in the habit_ of running dressed as a nun before he got the record?
22/10/2021, 09:51 - James Kemp: I asked what the hierarchy of quick costumes was
22/10/2021, 09:51 - James Kemp: Apparently the baby is the quickest
22/10/2021, 09:51 - Sam Lea: More aerodynamic?
22/10/2021, 09:51 - James Kemp: Exactly!
22/10/2021, 09:51 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah like you're just running in your underwear at that point eh
22/10/2021, 09:51 - James Kemp: But they stipulated a length for his habit and everything
22/10/2021, 09:52 - James Kemp: And when he collapsed (lol) he had to scream at them not to take it off as it‚Äôd invalidate his record
22/10/2021, 09:52 - Aaron Ayling: Haha priorities
22/10/2021, 09:53 - Aaron Ayling: I wonder if an actual nun (dressed however) has run a faster marathon than he has dressed as a nun
22/10/2021, 09:54 - Aaron Ayling: I'd guess yes? There's probably the odd distance running pro nun out there eh
22/10/2021, 09:54 - James Kemp: Surely, yeah
22/10/2021, 13:58 - +61 474 759 280: Hey! It‚Äôs freedom day in melbourne!
22/10/2021, 13:58 - +44 7752 359588: Congrats!
22/10/2021, 13:58 - +44 7752 359588: Have you gone round and licked every stranger!?
22/10/2021, 13:59 - +61 474 759 280: And you know how I celebrated? I introduced my girlfriend to 10 of my closest friends and accidentally called her Michelle, the name of an ex-girlfriend from 10 years ago that they all know!!!
22/10/2021, 13:59 - +61 474 759 280: üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

22/10/2021, 14:01 - James Kemp: LOL
22/10/2021, 14:02 - James Kemp: How was this taken?!
22/10/2021, 14:02 - James Kemp: By her and them and you?
22/10/2021, 14:02 - James Kemp: (In that order plz)
22/10/2021, 14:03 - +61 474 759 280: She has not taken it well
22/10/2021, 14:03 - +61 474 759 280: The crew were all GAGGED but carried on conversation promptly after
22/10/2021, 14:03 - +61 474 759 280: Not quickly enough for her to not notice however
22/10/2021, 14:03 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
22/10/2021, 14:06 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm texting from the toilet and need to go back in to fight for my god damn life now so I‚Äôll debrief you all tomorrow
22/10/2021, 14:06 - +61 474 759 280: Pray for mojo
22/10/2021, 14:07 - James Kemp: Oh god
22/10/2021, 14:07 - James Kemp: Godspeed, mate
22/10/2021, 14:07 - +44 7752 359588: AHHHH
22/10/2021, 14:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Godspeed Johnny
22/10/2021, 14:07 - James Kemp: Am around if you need an ear!!
22/10/2021, 14:07 - James Kemp: /shoulder
22/10/2021, 14:07 - James Kemp: üòÖ
22/10/2021, 14:07 - +44 7752 359588: But truly godspeed
22/10/2021, 14:08 - +44 7752 359588: (also seriously shouldn't be a big deal - ex from 10 years ago? That's clearly not a big threat! Not like we're talking most recent ex here)
22/10/2021, 14:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Also it happens! Feels like one that will be painful in the moment but funny later? Good luck man!
22/10/2021, 14:10 - +44 7752 359588: Probably why we should all just use one pet name for our partners and use the same one forever
22/10/2021, 14:10 - +44 7752 359588: Call them all babe
22/10/2021, 14:10 - +44 7752 359588: Impossible to screw up
22/10/2021, 14:10 - Reuben Yarwood: Awkward if that's also your dealer though
22/10/2021, 14:10 - +44 7752 359588: (bonus, you can call your dealer the same thing)
22/10/2021, 14:10 - +44 7752 359588: Lol
22/10/2021, 14:11 - Reuben Yarwood: "can't believe babe fucked us again"
22/10/2021, 14:11 - James Kemp: Has to be BABE tho
22/10/2021, 14:11 - James Kemp: Full caps
22/10/2021, 14:17 - +44 7462 872590: Ah man, hope it's all good. Yeah happens to the best of us. Totally agree with calling everyone by generic names. I suggest "man" for men and "mother" for women. Can't go wrong.
22/10/2021, 14:21 - +44 7462 872590: Very open to changing "man" to "daddy"
22/10/2021, 14:27 - Reuben Yarwood: "The is my girlfriend, mother"
22/10/2021, 14:27 - +44 7752 359588: George the first time you call me mother I'm going to scream
22/10/2021, 14:28 - +44 7752 359588: I will, however, start calling you all daddy
22/10/2021, 14:31 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha
22/10/2021, 14:32 - James Kemp: Also down for this
22/10/2021, 14:33 - James Kemp: Have to get down on your knees every time you say it
22/10/2021, 14:33 - +44 7462 872590: Will probably get very confusing
22/10/2021, 18:23 - Sam Lea: @ spooki boozers - literally about 5 minutes away on the bus üòñ
22/10/2021, 18:23 - +44 7752 359588: No wozzles!
22/10/2021, 18:23 - Aaron Ayling: No worries! We in the corner
22/10/2021, 18:25 - Sam Lea: You might have to ping me the first stop on the route in the event
22/10/2021, 18:29 - Aaron Ayling: They gave us a fake time - not gonna leave til 6.45
22/10/2021, 18:31 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm outside. Just got to make a call

22/10/2021, 22:57 - Reuben Yarwood: üëåüèª
22/10/2021, 22:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Was the intro when you first introd her John? Like on entry to the room? Or just a casual slip during the evening?
22/10/2021, 23:00 - Reuben Yarwood: Some uncertainty over here on how this played out.
22/10/2021, 23:00 - Reuben Yarwood: But good to hear it's blown over!
22/10/2021, 23:03 - +61 474 759 280: Towards the end of the evening / casual slip
22/10/2021, 23:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Liz was right!
22/10/2021, 23:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Definitely thought it was on intro!
22/10/2021, 23:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Was she okay with it?
22/10/2021, 23:08 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah the slip she didn‚Äôt care at all about, more that it was the first time she met everyone and the setting of it
22/10/2021, 23:09 - +61 474 759 280: What a day

24/10/2021, 00:04 - +61 474 759 280: Be aware: they are in no way related

27/10/2021, 06:11 - +61 474 759 280: Liz is it true Americans put sugar in their bread so most bread tastes sweet?
27/10/2021, 06:12 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúThe report stated that the average amount of sugar in an American loaf is 13.06 grams per 100g, which was more than the 11.25 g found in a Snickers bar (11.46g). The study also reported that some brands had up to 27g sugar per 100g. almost as much as Coca-Cola, at 30gm per 100ml.‚Äù ????

27/10/2021, 10:44 - +44 7752 359588: I mean maybe white bread?

17/11/2021, 12:33 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs a boot from me
17/11/2021, 12:42 - Aaron Ayling: Measuring volume for required ingredients instead of weight is dumb
17/11/2021, 12:42 - Aaron Ayling: Like the amount of space an ingredient takes up changes depending on how finely its chopped
17/11/2021, 12:44 - Aaron Ayling: "a cup of butter" cool well now I have to smush a load of butter into this measuring cup just let me put it on a scale and figure out how much I have regardless of size

17/11/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: And when you buy butter in the us, it's marked in quarter cup increments
17/11/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: Sometimes I like a cup!

01/12/2021, 09:11 - +44 7752 359588: Was told upon giving notice that they were considering creating an associate director role, which basically probably would have been mine, so mixed feelings there
01/12/2021, 09:11 - +44 7752 359588: Would have loved to have director in the title
01/12/2021, 09:11 - +44 7752 359588: But also could see the process dragging for ages and possibly never happening
01/12/2021, 09:11 - James Kemp: Ah how nice of them to say that when you‚Äôre leaving
01/12/2021, 09:11 - +44 7752 359588: And obviously wouldn't change america plans for that
01/12/2021, 09:11 - James Kemp: üôÑ

01/12/2021, 09:12 - +44 7752 359588: It wasn't in the context of oh you should stay
01/12/2021, 09:12 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently my boss had suggested the associate director thing, because she needs help
01/12/2021, 09:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah feels like they just said this because you were leaving
01/12/2021, 09:13 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
01/12/2021, 09:13 - +44 7752 359588: And our ED was like, but then we'd need to recruit for Elizabeth's role, for what would be a temp position
01/12/2021, 09:13 - +44 7752 359588: And my boss had basically said that I could leave tomorrow and they'd still need to recruit a replacement
01/12/2021, 09:13 - James Kemp: I have no time for this energy of telling you when you hand your notice in
01/12/2021, 09:13 - +44 7752 359588: So basically it was a "I thought you might go soon" response
01/12/2021, 09:14 - +44 7752 359588: Well anyways, happy to be going
01/12/2021, 09:14 - James Kemp: Yessssss!

01/12/2021, 10:01 - +61 474 759 280: üëÑ
01/12/2021, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: But yeah this is gross

01/12/2021, 10:31 - Sam Lea: So what's the plan, are you going to keep going until Feb as originally planned, or will you stop any sooner than that?
01/12/2021, 10:42 - +44 7752 359588: Still til Feb! They're keen for me to spend as much overlapping handover time as possible

05/12/2021, 14:39 - +44 7752 359588: Hahaha I was literally going to ask what you were going to get
05/12/2021, 14:39 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, that seems easy
05/12/2021, 14:40 - +44 7752 359588: Given that she likes any crystals and wants to be surprised
05/12/2021, 14:40 - James Kemp: get her a bag of tina
05/12/2021, 14:40 - James Kemp: surprise!

05/12/2021, 14:41 - James Kemp: my 4 categories: 1) stay awake; 2) let sleep; 3) give me drink; 4) where's the food?
05/12/2021, 14:41 - +44 7752 359588: 1. Drugs

05/12/2021, 14:44 - James Kemp: i appreciate that you removed the self-deprecating 'i am not the best with...' part for your version
05/12/2021, 14:44 - Reuben Yarwood: "I am the best with drugs"
05/12/2021, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I wasn't gonna tell lies
05/12/2021, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: Not when Santa might be reviewing this list
05/12/2021, 14:47 - +44 7752 359588: Also did she actually present this to her parents?
05/12/2021, 14:47 - James Kemp: good question
05/12/2021, 14:47 - James Kemp: i'm not sure how it was delivered
05/12/2021, 14:48 - James Kemp: gonna enjoy having actual teenagers to troll at christmas

06/12/2021, 16:05 - Aaron Ayling: Dunno if these will be age appropriate for your niblings Jim, but these seem like a pure evil thing to gift (from your siblings perspective)  https://yellies.hasbro.com/en-gb

07/12/2021, 15:56 - James Kemp: so i found out a fun (/disturbing) fact today
07/12/2021, 15:56 - James Kemp: hundreds of years ago, the cat and mutton pub used to be site to london's pig throwing contests
07/12/2021, 15:57 - James Kemp: locals would get a pig from nearby london fields
07/12/2021, 15:57 - James Kemp: release is through the streets, and whoever caught it and swung it around their head won
07/12/2021, 15:58 - James Kemp: (poor little porkers)
07/12/2021, 15:59 - Aaron Ayling: Deffo still happens in places https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_wrestling
07/12/2021, 15:59 - Aaron Ayling: Cool that there was a historical one still local!
07/12/2021, 16:00 - +44 7752 359588: Wtf
07/12/2021, 16:00 - +44 7752 359588: That is an excellent weird fact
07/12/2021, 16:00 - +44 7752 359588: How'd you learn this?
07/12/2021, 16:00 - +44 7752 359588: Also imagine if you could still just grab a pig from London fields?
07/12/2021, 16:02 - James Kemp: I was just googling around for inspo for the ole novel
07/12/2021, 16:02 - James Kemp: Wanted some fun historical details
07/12/2021, 16:02 - +44 7752 359588: Please tell me you're including pig throwing
07/12/2021, 16:02 - James Kemp: It does actually feature, yes!
07/12/2021, 16:02 - +44 7752 359588: YES
07/12/2021, 16:02 - James Kemp: More as a backdrop than a plot point
07/12/2021, 16:02 - +44 7752 359588: An excellent decision
07/12/2021, 16:33 - James Kemp: Imagine it was now the central plot
07/12/2021, 16:33 - James Kemp: A key part of the pig protagonist‚Äôs backstory - the time he got thrown across London Fields
07/12/2021, 16:35 - Aaron Ayling: I'd be there for a rags to riches story about the unlikely pig catching champ of Broadway Market
07/12/2021, 16:35 - Aaron Ayling: One day all the Kings pigs escape and noone else can catch em
07/12/2021, 16:44 - +44 7752 359588: This is a villain origin story
07/12/2021, 16:47 - +44 7752 359588: Would also read this
07/12/2021, 18:01 - James Kemp: Is it poor form to fake suspected COVID to get out of a plan?
07/12/2021, 18:01 - James Kemp: Coz I just did lol
07/12/2021, 18:05 - +44 7752 359588: I plan on using vaccine side effects to duck out of going into the office tomorrow

16/12/2021, 10:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Aaron/Liz how are you guys getting on? Did you get your massive stash of lateral flow tests into the country?
16/12/2021, 11:50 - +44 7752 359588: We did! Laurie was thrilled

18/12/2021, 13:57 - James Kemp: We didn‚Äôt, no! Didn‚Äôt fancy no cup o COVEED
18/12/2021, 15:16 - +44 7752 359588: The most delicious snack
18/12/2021, 15:16 - +44 7752 359588: (for those I have not yet texted, I tested positive yesterday üôÉ)
18/12/2021, 15:18 - +44 7752 359588: But so far feels like the mildest of colds and fingers crossed it stays that way
18/12/2021, 15:18 - +44 7752 359588: Did live my best Jim Kemp life yesterday and slept 12 hours (from 4:30pm-4:30am)
18/12/2021, 15:35 - +44 7462 872590: Hope you feel better soon Liz!
18/12/2021, 15:36 - +44 7752 359588: Thanks! Feel pretty good for the moment, so I hope it just stays like this
18/12/2021, 16:35 - Sam Lea: At least it happened _after_ you flew... (?)
18/12/2021, 16:35 - +44 7752 359588: I think that's probably a good thing? Although I would have probably preferred isolating in my flat in the UK. And also hoping I haven't given it to my parents
18/12/2021, 16:36 - Sam Lea: True... Have you got space to keep seperate while you isolate?
18/12/2021, 16:38 - +44 7752 359588: Yep! I'm extremely separate - just staying in my room and I have my own bathroom anyways
18/12/2021, 16:39 - +44 7752 359588: Occasionally going to the kitchen when they're asleep, like a spoopy ghost haha
18/12/2021, 16:39 - James Kemp: REIGN!!
18/12/2021, 16:39 - +44 7752 359588: It was truly delightful
18/12/2021, 16:39 - Sam Lea: That's a bummer. Hope you're feeling better soon... Honestly the booster made me feel worse than the 'rona itself, so (fingers crossed) you'll be feeling 100% again in no time
18/12/2021, 16:39 - James Kemp: Which Hogwarts ghost was the fiercest?
18/12/2021, 16:39 - James Kemp: You could be the Gay Lady
18/12/2021, 16:39 - +44 7752 359588: LOL
18/12/2021, 16:40 - +44 7752 359588: I mean nearly headless nick was a good time (I can't name that many other ones üôÉ)
18/12/2021, 16:40 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I genuinely feel very fine right now, so fingers crossed it stays this way
18/12/2021, 16:40 - +44 7752 359588: Ive had far worse colds - this barely feels like anything
18/12/2021, 16:42 - Sam Lea: I mean, Moaning Myrtle would be a fairly strong drag name...
18/12/2021, 16:42 - +44 7752 359588: Omg yea
18/12/2021, 18:24 - James Kemp: Omg!
18/12/2021, 18:24 - James Kemp: This is so good yes!

19/12/2021, 03:02 - +61 474 759 280: Hope you‚Äôre feeling better soon Lizzard. I had a weak positive rapid antigen test yesterday so waiting on a PCR result now. Just sitting at home eating biscuits.
19/12/2021, 03:07 - +44 7752 359588: Oh no! Hope it's negative, but if you end up stuck in covid isolation, I'd be well down for some gaming seshes
19/12/2021, 11:54 - James Kemp: How you faring today, Lizzmas?
19/12/2021, 13:02 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah still ok! Feeling slightly coldier, but it doesn't feel worse than a run of the mill cold!
19/12/2021, 13:03 - Reuben Yarwood: How long until you escape self-isolation? Are you coping alright?
19/12/2021, 13:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Also down for some gaming this week!
19/12/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: Haha basically another full week
19/12/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: I'm fine though
19/12/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: I'm very suited to sitting around in my bed doing nothing
19/12/2021, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: I'm sure I'll get a bit stir crazy soon, but for the most part it's fine
19/12/2021, 13:04 - Reuben Yarwood: So a Christmas Dinner in bed?
19/12/2021, 13:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Good to hear you're coping alright though
19/12/2021, 13:05 - +44 7752 359588: If I get over symptoms and the lateral flows start looking negative, I might rejoin the household earlier so fingers crossed
19/12/2021, 13:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Fingers crossed!
19/12/2021, 13:05 - +44 7752 359588: My cousin also tested positive the same day as me, so at least I'm not the only bitch knocked out right now
19/12/2021, 13:06 - +44 7752 359588: And she's feeling way worse because she hasn't been boostered and got fully vaxxed almost a year ago now
19/12/2021, 13:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Ah. Booster babe. Is Aaron still testing negative?

19/12/2021, 13:09 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm actually surprised I didn't pick something up at Winter Wonderland. Or I'm just testing incorrectly
19/12/2021, 13:09 - James Kemp: Yeah, we‚Äôre both fine somehow!
19/12/2021, 13:09 - Reuben Yarwood: On the plus side Liz, your parents are basically your servants for the next week
19/12/2021, 13:10 - +44 7752 359588: I'm glad I'm the only one who got got! I suppose it could have been belatedly from my work do, where someone definitely tested positive
19/12/2021, 13:10 - +44 7752 359588: Actually it's been Aaron so far haha
19/12/2021, 13:10 - James Kemp: Or from when you frenched Joseph

19/12/2021, 23:00 - +61 474 759 280: I think the line is saying you actually have COVID
19/12/2021, 23:01 - +61 474 759 280: Faking suspected COVID gives you leeway
19/12/2021, 23:02 - James Kemp: Yep I upgraded to this to get out of plans Friday
19/12/2021, 23:02 - James Kemp: Great minds
19/12/2021, 23:05 - +44 7752 359588: LOL

19/12/2021, 23:19 - +61 474 759 280: This is for balcony furniture
19/12/2021, 23:20 - James Kemp: Dani is going to have huge opinions on this
19/12/2021, 23:20 - +61 474 759 280: And I invite them!
19/12/2021, 23:20 - James Kemp: Canvassing
19/12/2021, 23:20 - +61 474 759 280: The bigger the better
19/12/2021, 23:21 - +61 474 759 280: Opinions, not furniture
19/12/2021, 23:21 - +61 474 759 280: Ultimately I‚Äôm going with Ikea because nowhere else appears to make furniture for apartment size balconies

19/12/2021, 23:23 - James Kemp: Looks super fuckin cosy!

19/12/2021, 23:24 - +61 474 759 280: Buttholeman just has that stand going for it
19/12/2021, 23:24 - +44 7752 359588: Oh I like the table! But you can easily get a side table
19/12/2021, 23:24 - +44 7752 359588: I like grey upholstery tho haha
19/12/2021, 23:25 - +61 474 759 280: And I do thing the grey will hold up better outside
19/12/2021, 23:25 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôll just need to sort a cover for it
19/12/2021, 23:25 - +61 474 759 280: Think*
19/12/2021, 23:27 - Aaron Ayling: I'd go for buttholeman I think!
19/12/2021, 23:29 - Aaron Ayling: While number 1 looks comfy I get a bit weirded out by comfy outdoor furniture?
19/12/2021, 23:29 - Aaron Ayling: Like the damp will just ruin all the fluff or whatever
19/12/2021, 23:29 - +61 474 759 280: The havsten is just on the cusp of possibly being too large
19/12/2021, 23:30 - James Kemp: Definitely sturdier, just not as cool?!
19/12/2021, 23:30 - James Kemp: Cool and impractical all the way!!
19/12/2021, 23:33 - +61 474 759 280: Much to ponder
19/12/2021, 23:37 - +61 474 759 280: Thank you, hive mind!
19/12/2021, 23:37 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I imagine the damp isn't a massive issue in oz?
19/12/2021, 23:38 - +61 474 759 280: Not really no
19/12/2021, 23:38 - +61 474 759 280: I still would probably get a cover for it so it‚Äôs not caked in dirt
19/12/2021, 23:39 - +61 474 759 280: That goes for both piece
20/12/2021, 00:48 - +44 7752 359588: https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/mariah-menu.html
20/12/2021, 00:49 - +44 7752 359588: Hope the website doesn't redirect you, because US McDonald's is doing a Mariah Carey Christmas menu and it is making me lol
20/12/2021, 00:49 - +44 7752 359588: It's basically an advent calendar?
20/12/2021, 00:49 - +61 474 759 280: Fucking hell
20/12/2021, 00:49 - +44 7752 359588: The ad also feels very dystopian
20/12/2021, 00:49 - +61 474 759 280: This isn‚Äôt even her final form
20/12/2021, 11:17 - James Kemp: Tbf it‚Äôd totally work on this fag

20/12/2021, 17:36 - +44 7752 359588: Didn't you have your own b and b exorcism a while back? Are all b and bs in your town haunted?
20/12/2021, 17:37 - +44 7462 872590: Don't know anymore details about the dead body. Just that "accidents happen"
20/12/2021, 17:38 - +44 7752 359588: üëªüëª
20/12/2021, 17:38 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah we've been exorcised. Was a few decades back so could do with a booster probably
20/12/2021, 17:39 - +44 7752 359588: Oh yeah you got to exorcise every 2 years or the anti-boodies get too low

24/12/2021, 12:55 - +61 474 759 280: Merry Christmas Mr Worldwide,
It‚Äôs been a dumpster fire of a year, in a lot of ways more so than 2020 given the promises we gave ourselves. I hope you‚Äôre all taking care of yourselves, and I‚Äôm sorry that I haven‚Äôt been in touch as much as I should have recently. I want you to know that I look back really fondly on my days in London, not just because of how the world was back then but because of the friendships I made with you and how at home and safe you all made me feel. Without wanting to get too cringe it‚Äôs something I think I‚Äôll probably chase for the rest of my life and I‚Äôm glad, if only for a fleeting time in the scheme of things, that I got to have that with you. Have a merry Christmas and a great break, much love, your Stowellman xoxox
24/12/2021, 12:59 - James Kemp: Ahhhh Johnny! ‚ù§Ô∏è The era may be over, but the friendships ain‚Äôt, mate! We‚Äôre gonna carry on spreading across the globe, but we‚Äôre all still _here_! Love you,, mate and merry fucking Christmas!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

01/02/2022, 05:45 - +61 474 759 280: Also had a laugh because his job now is Global VP of Sports, Entertainment and Media at Anhueser-Busch InBev in NY and he toned it all the way down to ‚Äúadvertising consultant‚Äù in his on screen bio, presumably to appear more Everyman and not as The Man
01/02/2022, 08:08 - +44 7752 359588: Ahaha this is amazing!!!

12/02/2022, 11:07 - +44 7752 359588: I do find it gross how swole they are
13/02/2022, 03:54 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
13/02/2022, 10:37 - +61 474 759 280: !?? https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-60364090

13/02/2022, 11:29 - +44 7752 359588: So this is going to Eurovision
13/02/2022, 11:29 - +44 7752 359588: The tragedy is that the first line has already been censored for the official version üò≠
13/02/2022, 11:31 - +44 7752 359588: There were some other interesting selections yesterday, including Ukraine which, while not as excellent as GoA was still pretty good, and this weird western themed Estonian entry which featured a very brief gun duel on stage
13/02/2022, 15:17 - James Kemp: Omg that opening line
13/02/2022, 15:18 - +44 7752 359588: I mean that's the bit that matters
13/02/2022, 15:18 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think they'll be spelling pussy out in the finals, but in their latest performance the singer does give his lip a cheeky little wipe
13/02/2022, 17:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Good lord
13/02/2022, 23:16 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>

14/02/2022, 11:43 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
14/02/2022, 11:44 - James Kemp: (tldr: i love attention more than i love the output of this project)

14/02/2022, 11:46 - James Kemp: ü•∞

14/02/2022, 12:37 - Sam Lea: Nice! Are you going to be hosting / speaking?
14/02/2022, 12:39 - James Kemp: Wasn‚Äôt planning on it?! Just gonna turn up and play it low key
14/02/2022, 12:39 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúOh the podcast? Yeah I made it nbd‚Äù
14/02/2022, 13:26 - Sam Lea: Lol soz, meant more what sort of format will it take, how are you going to be presenting / hosting it - have you got any of the guests from the pod making an appearance?
14/02/2022, 13:26 - James Kemp: Oh I have no idea!
14/02/2022, 13:27 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm doing the bare minimum (aka actually quite a lot) and making the thing
14/02/2022, 13:27 - James Kemp: Then just gonna turn up stoned and see what happens üôÉ
15/02/2022, 09:25 - James Kemp: Happy last weeeeeek @447752359588!!
15/02/2022, 09:25 - James Kemp: Are you feeling (emotionally) ready to gtfo?!
15/02/2022, 10:05 - +61 474 759 280: You have been there for 10 years
15/02/2022, 10:05 - +61 474 759 280: Or since birth I‚Äôm not sure
15/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: I am very ready to go
15/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: (and not ready at all, both mentally and also in terms of handover)
15/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: Almost cried twice at applications now (for nice reasons)
15/02/2022, 10:09 - +44 7752 359588: Also nearly lost my shit yesterday when a candidate told us "legally, you can't be racist"
15/02/2022, 10:12 - +61 474 759 280: You see such a spectrum of freaks
15/02/2022, 10:12 - +44 7752 359588: (he still got the award)
15/02/2022, 10:12 - +61 474 759 280: All 31 flavours
15/02/2022, 10:12 - +61 474 759 280: WOT
15/02/2022, 10:13 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs going to be weird for you when eventually you have a job that doesn‚Äôt give you access to the warped minds of college grads
15/02/2022, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: He was trying to talk about how racism manifests through socioeconomic disparities, housing discrimination, etc, so I'm pretty sure he was trying to say you can't outright discriminate, but that it manifests in other ways
15/02/2022, 10:14 - +61 474 759 280: But I guess there‚Äôs always Reddit?
15/02/2022, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: Which is incorrect and naive, but hey the point of a masters is to learn eh
15/02/2022, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: And he was better than the other candidate
15/02/2022, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: What will I do when I'm not counselling students through their mental health and housing crises?
15/02/2022, 10:15 - +61 474 759 280: See I‚Äôve only ever heard of the insane submissions you‚Äôre privy to. I‚Äôm sure the bulk of your work is very rewarding
15/02/2022, 10:21 - +44 7752 359588: Most of it is probably pretty average, some great, some nuts
15/02/2022, 10:21 - +44 7752 359588: But man I am ready to become one with the couch next week
15/02/2022, 10:22 - +61 474 759 280: You thought about what you want to do in Murica?
15/02/2022, 10:22 - +44 7752 359588: NO IDEA
15/02/2022, 10:22 - +61 474 759 280: üòé
15/02/2022, 10:22 - +44 7752 359588: BE A WOMAN OF LEISURE

15/02/2022, 10:23 - +61 474 759 280: International flight are back, I‚Äôll come crash on your couch some time ü§ô
15/02/2022, 10:32 - +44 7752 359588: üéâ
15/02/2022, 10:36 - James Kemp: JUST FO‚Äô MO‚Äô DAYS
15/02/2022, 10:37 - James Kemp: Am I bringing the ket on Saturday that‚Äôs the question
15/02/2022, 10:37 - James Kemp: (Doing this to maintain my record of talking the most about ket in the group chat)
15/02/2022, 10:37 - James Kemp: (And also bc I wanna know)
15/02/2022, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: I mean it's not for me
15/02/2022, 10:59 - +44 7752 359588: But y'all get your groove on
15/02/2022, 11:01 - James Kemp: üòè
15/02/2022, 11:08 - +61 474 759 280: Haha forgot about this
15/02/2022, 11:28 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
15/02/2022, 11:28 - Reuben Yarwood: Back in the office. Kill me.
15/02/2022, 11:31 - Sam Lea: How often are you back in from now on?
15/02/2022, 11:32 - Sam Lea: Can you still do some WFH
15/02/2022, 11:38 - James Kemp: Are we still talking about ket because I‚Äôm sure I can?
15/02/2022, 11:39 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
15/02/2022, 11:39 - James Kemp: Though at least there‚Äôs no dystopian slogans here
15/02/2022, 11:43 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
15/02/2022, 11:44 - Sam Lea: My lot have lured us back in with a corporate-branded rubber duck
15/02/2022, 11:44 - Sam Lea: Worth every litre of record-high petrol
15/02/2022, 11:44 - +61 474 759 280: Zold
15/02/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: I'm also in the office
15/02/2022, 11:46 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
15/02/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: Getting one of my 2 days a month out the way
15/02/2022, 11:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Every day. We may be getting Macbooks in the future and moving to a 3 day week but not likely until the next financial year in October at the earliest
15/02/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: This is still such a joke I live
15/02/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: Do they not hear how stupid it sounds coming out of their mouths?
15/02/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúTwo days a month‚Äù
15/02/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: If it‚Äôs pointless, let‚Äôs just call it pointless?!
15/02/2022, 11:55 - Aaron Ayling: I think they're hamstrung by hiring people who live miles away during Lockdown
15/02/2022, 11:55 - Aaron Ayling: Can't do one rule for them and another for us
15/02/2022, 11:56 - James Kemp: Then just say zero? Anyone do whatever? It‚Äôs the same here at the Council, just beating the drum ‚Äúbecause‚Äù
15/02/2022, 11:57 - James Kemp: This is also wild!!
15/02/2022, 11:57 - James Kemp: What a world
15/02/2022, 11:58 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I think it's also that we don't want to lose our assigned desks in the guildhall. There's some weird politics around our organisation being "hosted" by City of London but not fully CoL?
15/02/2022, 11:58 - James Kemp: Management here just can‚Äôt face up to the fact that 90% of our office space has been proven to be 100% useless
15/02/2022, 11:59 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah same
15/02/2022, 11:59 - James Kemp: Feels like a big silly dance that nobody‚Äôs even trying to justify beyond ‚Äújust because‚Äù
15/02/2022, 12:07 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
15/02/2022, 12:08 - +61 474 759 280: She‚Äôs considering doing it for an extra $100, but feels like a slippery slope?
15/02/2022, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: Haha I thi k this toes the line of "reasonable request"?
15/02/2022, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: Now if it was socks we're getting sketchy
15/02/2022, 12:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah my guys have opened this office during the pandemic, I guess to consolidate all the companies they've bought up. And asking everyone to come in 3x per week
15/02/2022, 12:12 - Reuben Yarwood: I get that it works better for some people but I'm sure the majority would rather wfh
15/02/2022, 12:17 - +44 7752 359588: Oh man... For $100 bucks? I probably would
15/02/2022, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: But I'd also sell farts in a jar if I was fit enough to get a good price, so you know
15/02/2022, 12:19 - +61 474 759 280: Also Only Fans but ‚Äújust hands stuff‚Äù(?)
15/02/2022, 12:20 - +61 474 759 280: I think she meant of the glove variety but I didn‚Äôt press it
15/02/2022, 12:20 - +44 7752 359588: üòÇ
15/02/2022, 12:20 - +44 7752 359588: Does she have particularly alluring hands?
15/02/2022, 12:20 - +61 474 759 280: No
15/02/2022, 12:21 - +61 474 759 280: I don‚Äôt say that maliciously she just doesn‚Äôt
15/02/2022, 12:21 - +61 474 759 280: On wfh, no sign of going back for Johnyboy
15/02/2022, 12:22 - +61 474 759 280: But if I‚Äôm starting up an Only Fans couples page for glove stuff that‚Äôs a given
15/02/2022, 12:28 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm going to bed now but want to know if anyone‚Äôs still trading crypto and if so, what‚Äôs the latest? @447725504296 @447462872590 @447595390314 @447940330084?
15/02/2022, 12:43 - Reuben Yarwood: I've basically given up on trying to trade or ever make money and just have a bit I'm holding onto.
15/02/2022, 12:43 - Reuben Yarwood: The dream!
15/02/2022, 12:44 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah I'm not touching crypto
15/02/2022, 13:27 - Aaron Ayling: Agreed
15/02/2022, 17:52 - James Kemp: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60393843
15/02/2022, 17:52 - James Kemp: Boooooooooo
15/02/2022, 17:53 - James Kemp: Wanted to see the melting hound dragged through the courts
15/02/2022, 18:00 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah agreed.

He also commended the "bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others".

Bleurgh
15/02/2022, 18:01 - Aaron Ayling: More like he reached a sweattlement am I right
15/02/2022, 18:01 - James Kemp: No that‚Äôs the exact opposite of what just happened
15/02/2022, 18:01 - Reuben Yarwood: I wonder where the settlement money is coming from.
15/02/2022, 18:01 - James Kemp: A no sweattlement?!
15/02/2022, 18:02 - James Kemp: I doubt he‚Äôs struggling
15/02/2022, 18:03 - James Kemp: It would‚Äôve been the perfect car crash - Jubilee year trial
15/02/2022, 18:32 - James Kemp: also ukraine entry SUSPENDED from eurovision?!
15/02/2022, 19:07 - Sam Lea: that's not very lasha tumbai üôÅ
15/02/2022, 19:10 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh I'd heard this might happen!
15/02/2022, 19:10 - +44 7752 359588: Contestant illegally entered Crimea back in 2015
15/02/2022, 19:11 - +44 7752 359588: It's a shame cause it was a banger
15/02/2022, 19:12 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd re-roll, personally
15/02/2022, 19:12 - James Kemp: At least on first lesson
15/02/2022, 19:12 - James Kemp: Listen*
15/02/2022, 19:23 - Reuben Yarwood: It's very earnest isn't it
15/02/2022, 19:30 - +44 7752 359588: But her fun bird chirps!!
15/02/2022, 19:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah! Definitely my fave bit
15/02/2022, 19:35 - James Kemp: Will rewatch and review
15/02/2022, 19:45 - James Kemp: Today I learned that Argentinians give the combination of ketchup and Mayo its own name
15/02/2022, 19:45 - James Kemp: And that name is ‚Äúgolf sauce‚Äù
15/02/2022, 19:45 - James Kemp: Dumb?!
15/02/2022, 19:48 - Aaron Ayling: Haha yeah I don't love that name. What do we call it? Marie Rose sauce?
15/02/2022, 19:59 - +44 7462 872590: Back in London on 19th, so keen for this!
15/02/2022, 20:01 - Aaron Ayling: Ooh fuck yeah!

15/02/2022, 20:16 - +44 7752 359588: I realize I'm slacking on actually nailing anything down on this, my brain is ded
15/02/2022, 20:17 - +44 7752 359588: I was maybe thinking Highbury and Islington for max convenience for everyone? Vicky line for Aaron and I and all the southerners, overground for Jim and Dani?
15/02/2022, 20:17 - +44 7752 359588: But my knowledge of high and I is spottier and should probably book something
15/02/2022, 20:19 - James Kemp: I don‚Äôt necessarily need convenience if we‚Äôre doing an all dayer
15/02/2022, 20:20 - +44 7752 359588: OH ARE WE TALKING ALL DAY

16/02/2022, 13:40 - Aaron Ayling: Hackney Salt Bae is alright
16/02/2022, 13:41 - Aaron Ayling: As is Great Gritsby I suppose
16/02/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: i'm thinking 'mr crumpet' and 'snowflake truck' for the simplicity of it
16/02/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: i have no idea what mr crumpet is getting at but i like crumpets
16/02/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: (and turtles)

16/02/2022, 13:44 - James Kemp: i also wanna know how they decided the order on this list
16/02/2022, 13:44 - James Kemp: because it's not alphabetical
16/02/2022, 13:44 - James Kemp: is this a fair question or are we being manipulated
16/02/2022, 13:44 - James Kemp: it's very important
16/02/2022, 13:44 - Aaron Ayling: i think forms like that randomise the order?
16/02/2022, 13:44 - James Kemp: that's what they _say_
16/02/2022, 13:44 - James Kemp: üëÄ
16/02/2022, 13:45 - James Kemp: 45 yo tweaker reading signs in the voting list

17/02/2022, 09:58 - +44 7752 359588: But also 100% looks like it would fuck you up
17/02/2022, 09:59 - +44 7752 359588: Does it not belong to someone there? An interloper???
17/02/2022, 09:59 - +44 7752 359588: I wish our building group chat had this much cat drama in it
17/02/2022, 09:59 - James Kemp: Giving me slight Stuart Little villain vibes
17/02/2022, 09:59 - James Kemp: But more street
17/02/2022, 10:02 - +44 7752 359588: I just can't stop looking at it
17/02/2022, 10:02 - +44 7752 359588: So fluffy. So dainty. Such a scowling face
17/02/2022, 10:03 - Reuben Yarwood: It's an intruder
17/02/2022, 10:03 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
17/02/2022, 10:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Jim your Monstera is absolutely stunning
17/02/2022, 10:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh my God. Now Ella is getting stuck into the Quad chat.
17/02/2022, 10:08 - Reuben Yarwood: She's having a go at a different cat
17/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: YES ELLA
17/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: READ THE CATS
17/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: What's her beef with this one?
17/02/2022, 10:08 - Reuben Yarwood: Will explain in Sat
17/02/2022, 10:08 - +44 7752 359588: Also how does Joni hold up in the fighting?
17/02/2022, 10:09 - +44 7752 359588: I genuinely cannot wait to get all the catfight tea
17/02/2022, 10:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Long and probably quite boring story
17/02/2022, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: Please never underestimate my interest in petty building drama
17/02/2022, 10:14 - +44 7752 359588: Especially when cats are involved
17/02/2022, 10:14 - Aaron Ayling: can't wait
17/02/2022, 10:15 - Aaron Ayling: Loving updates on Moggyoaks
17/02/2022, 10:20 - +44 7752 359588: Took me a while but I get it now
17/02/2022, 10:21 - Aaron Ayling: I was also thinking Claw-ination Street but multiple animals have claws
17/02/2022, 11:01 - James Kemp: Oh damn this is juice
17/02/2022, 11:02 - James Kemp: Also isn‚Äôt it quite high stakes getting stuck in with neighbour drama when the quad is so small?!
17/02/2022, 11:02 - James Kemp: (That‚Äôs why I love it obv but stressful?!)
17/02/2022, 11:03 - James Kemp: üíØ
17/02/2022, 11:11 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
17/02/2022, 11:11 - Reuben Yarwood: This has escalated beyond cat-cat beef
17/02/2022, 11:11 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
17/02/2022, 11:12 - Reuben Yarwood: People are threatening water pistol action
17/02/2022, 11:13 - Aaron Ayling: haha is water pistols "cruel and unnesesary"?
17/02/2022, 11:13 - Aaron Ayling: what did Angela say
17/02/2022, 11:13 - Aaron Ayling: Andrea*
17/02/2022, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Ella mentioned in the group that Andrea's cats are picking on Joni (I think I showed you a vid a while ago of her batting at the cat flap? That was those two trying to get in) and Andrea was basically like "what, my angels? I always see Joni chasing them!"
17/02/2022, 11:18 - Aaron Ayling: haha
17/02/2022, 11:28 - +61 474 759 280: Initially read as ‚ÄúI have no objections to shooting cat‚Äù
17/02/2022, 11:29 - +61 474 759 280: Surely water is less cruel than their eyes getting gouged out
17/02/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: This is a mess!

17/02/2022, 12:14 - +44 7752 359588: Is that not the appeal?
17/02/2022, 12:23 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm not a part of, and would never want to be a part of, a neighbours‚Äô group chat
17/02/2022, 12:23 - James Kemp: What‚Äôs the t in yours @447752359588??

17/02/2022, 12:29 - +44 7752 359588: Interviewing today and then tying up everything I can tomorrow
17/02/2022, 12:30 - +44 7752 359588: Just got told I can't come into the office because of high winds, so I'll need to drop everything off next week which is rude
17/02/2022, 12:31 - James Kemp: Oh boooooo
17/02/2022, 12:31 - James Kemp: Tbf you would 100% end up getting blown into the Thames
17/02/2022, 12:31 - James Kemp: Feels very Liz
17/02/2022, 12:33 - +44 7752 359588: But what a way to go
17/02/2022, 12:34 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah the windows in the office are terrible and we need to keep them open because covid
17/02/2022, 12:49 - Reuben Yarwood: üòÇ

18/02/2022, 10:04 - James Kemp: Quite a middle class storm name, this one?
18/02/2022, 10:08 - Sam Lea: The name of a wealthy old dowager who eats prunes
18/02/2022, 10:13 - James Kemp: in celebration of your last day, liz
18/02/2022, 10:13 - James Kemp: i made you a meme
18/02/2022, 10:13 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
18/02/2022, 10:15 - James Kemp: (because the left was the first song that came into my mind when i woke up this morning)
18/02/2022, 10:16 - +44 7752 359588: I LOVE IT IMMENSELY THANK YOU
18/02/2022, 11:31 - Reuben Yarwood: @447462872590 and @447595390314 how are you guys doing with the packing?
18/02/2022, 11:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Must be quite a schlep for you George?
18/02/2022, 11:33 - +44 7462 872590: Hahahaha yeah I'm getting through it
18/02/2022, 11:36 - Reuben Yarwood: Good luck with it!
18/02/2022, 11:39 - Sam Lea: We're just crunching the numbers re: energy suppliers, obviously every property's different but I don't suppose any of you know roughly how much energy you get through with two of you working from home?!
18/02/2022, 11:40 - Sam Lea: (or if you have any hot tips on any suppliers who you think "are good")
18/02/2022, 11:42 - Aaron Ayling: Absolutely no idea my approach to bills is üôàüôâ
18/02/2022, 11:43 - Sam Lea: fair
18/02/2022, 11:43 - Aaron Ayling: Which is a privileged position to be in I realise, it just everything related to being an adult is so _draining_ that I have to pick my battles
18/02/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: I think we spend ¬£60pm on electricity and ¬£60pm on heating and then the Thames water bill is something like ¬£120 every 6 months? (so ¬£20 pm)
18/02/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: I'm also not convinced that the electricity isn't underestimating our usage and we'll be hit with a big bill when we leave)
18/02/2022, 11:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah same. I used to use Ecotricity at Cazenove for electricity and gas because they're eco, price is all roughly the same and their customer service is great. The price may have changed though
18/02/2022, 12:36 - +44 7752 359588: Our heating is insite energy, and arguably not terribly efficient in the winter
18/02/2022, 16:48 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
18/02/2022, 16:48 - James Kemp: she blew me GOOD
18/02/2022, 16:49 - Aaron Ayling: It was grim out today eh

18/02/2022, 17:47 - +61 474 759 280: That coupled with the airborne wheelie bin looks like some real end of days shit
18/02/2022, 17:50 - Aaron Ayling: Million Dome roof has ripped too haha

19/02/2022, 09:46 - +44 7752 359588: They said they're signing the contract, so if Russia doesn't totally topple Ukraine before May, this will be it

19/02/2022, 10:17 - James Kemp: I would definitely put a ‚Äúlive Eurovision‚Äù on my bucket list
19/02/2022, 10:17 - James Kemp: (If I had one)
19/02/2022, 10:18 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah I think tickets are ridiculous so the sensible play is go for a semi final and enjoy the fun Eurovision club night vibes around said city then fly home to enjoy the finals on a telly
19/02/2022, 10:18 - James Kemp: I literally saw you typing and was like ‚ÄúAaron wants to go to the semi instead‚Äù

19/02/2022, 10:26 - James Kemp: Nbd if there‚Äôs a riot as long as that camera angle POPS
19/02/2022, 10:29 - +44 7752 359588: What's a soft drug?

24/02/2022, 10:01 - +44 7752 359588: So I basically have to dump it and run

24/02/2022, 10:19 - +61 474 759 280: There‚Äôs a civil war in Ethiopia, Namibia has no vaccines and Ukraine is, well

24/02/2022, 10:22 - +61 474 759 280: I think Ethiopia is probably the one

24/02/2022, 10:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Ukraine! Change from the inside
24/02/2022, 10:36 - James Kemp: Very good

24/02/2022, 10:39 - James Kemp: He messaged Dani yday saying he saw demons but told them he saw butterflies
24/02/2022, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: Omg this whole story makes me lol
24/02/2022, 10:40 - James Kemp: Mess, right?!
24/02/2022, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: I guess Ethiopia?
24/02/2022, 10:40 - +44 7752 359588: I mean how vaccinated are they

24/02/2022, 10:49 - +44 7752 359588: Probably because we ventured into a spoons
24/02/2022, 10:49 - +44 7752 359588: (actually the axe feels like the more likely culprit
24/02/2022, 10:50 - +44 7752 359588: Hope Dani is feeling ok
24/02/2022, 10:52 - +44 7752 359588: Also feels weird I've not been pinged yet
24/02/2022, 10:52 - +44 7752 359588: Has the pinging stopped?
24/02/2022, 10:54 - +44 7462 872590: Has the app been binned?
24/02/2022, 10:55 - +44 7752 359588: I don't know!
24/02/2022, 10:56 - +44 7752 359588: I guess legally you don't have to isolate anymore and I heard they were winding down test and trace
24/02/2022, 11:10 - James Kemp: I never had it üôà
24/02/2022, 11:15 - +44 7462 872590: Hope you're feeling fine!
24/02/2022, 11:18 - Sam Lea: Yeah, rest up guys - a pain to have to isolate
24/02/2022, 11:19 - Sam Lea: I had the app then binned it pretty swiftly when the 'Bluetooth Low Energy battery-saving technology' turned out to be, erm, bollocks and just meant I was wandering around with a phone constantly about to die
24/02/2022, 11:20 - +44 7752 359588: I've had it the whole time, only been pinged 2 or 3 times?
24/02/2022, 11:20 - +44 7752 359588: To be fair, one of them might have been when I caught it
24/02/2022, 11:22 - James Kemp: Frisby also came into London and also caught COVID this weekend
24/02/2022, 11:22 - James Kemp: 3 down in one weekend!

24/02/2022, 11:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Don't mind me just going to shove something up my nose

09/03/2022, 22:31 - James Kemp: (Technically, 3 teams should‚Äôve been tied for first place)
09/03/2022, 22:31 - James Kemp: (But we won lmao)
09/03/2022, 22:31 - +61 474 759 280: üèÖ
09/03/2022, 22:32 - James Kemp: ¬£82 bar tab
09/03/2022, 22:32 - James Kemp: Is what we won
09/03/2022, 22:32 - +61 474 759 280: You spen it?
09/03/2022, 22:32 - James Kemp: Rolling it over to spend next week
09/03/2022, 22:32 - +61 474 759 280: Yesss
09/03/2022, 22:33 - +61 474 759 280: Who was the MVP?
09/03/2022, 22:33 - +61 474 759 280: My phone just autocorrected ‚Äúwhowas‚Äù to ‚Äúwhoaaaa‚Äù
09/03/2022, 22:34 - James Kemp: Well we only one by one point, and everyone contributed at least one answer that nobody else knew??!
09/03/2022, 22:35 - James Kemp: So I‚Äôm going to diplomatically say TEAM SLAY
09/03/2022, 22:35 - James Kemp: (I was definitely not the MVP tho)
09/03/2022, 22:36 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm going to need @447912940213 distinterested verdict on this
09/03/2022, 22:37 - +61 474 759 280: What say you lawful neutral
09/03/2022, 22:55 - Aaron Ayling: Oh yeah total team effort tonight. I think I contributed the least!

Slight bad taste in thr mouth as we won by 1 point, but put an incorrect answer down. The quizmaster also had the incorrect answer as the correct answer.

So really we should have 1 point less and come joint first with 2 other teams but hey ho it goes that way sometimes.
09/03/2022, 23:02 - Sam Lea: @447912940213 @447752359588 Liz is it the weekend of the 19th you're back in London before going to the state for a few weeks?
09/03/2022, 23:03 - Aaron Ayling: I believe so yes!
09/03/2022, 23:23 - Sam Lea: *going to the State (plural)
09/03/2022, 23:38 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs life! (Tommy Wisseau voice)
10/03/2022, 02:04 - +61 474 759 280: We are days away from the Ents emerging from the red forest in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and fucking everyone up
10/03/2022, 07:03 - +44 7752 359588: Yes, this is correct!
10/03/2022, 08:05 - +44 7752 359588: Wait I need to know what the incorrect answer was
10/03/2022, 08:39 - James Kemp: It was something like ‚Äúwhich country‚Äôs internet domain changed from .yu to .me when it became an independent state?‚Äù
10/03/2022, 08:39 - James Kemp: We put Macedonia
10/03/2022, 08:39 - James Kemp: But it was Montenegro?
10/03/2022, 08:40 - James Kemp: (Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong - meta!)
10/03/2022, 08:41 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah Jim's right
10/03/2022, 08:41 - Aaron Ayling: Quizmaster said it was Macedonia. Googling afterwards showed it was Montenegro.
10/03/2022, 08:42 - James Kemp: We beat the reigning champions by 1 point as a result lmao
10/03/2022, 08:42 - Aaron Ayling: The guys in 3rd got a bottle of house wine as an apology (the second place prize) and we got to keep our first place.
10/03/2022, 08:42 - James Kemp: They were pretty good sports about it?!
10/03/2022, 08:42 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah!
10/03/2022, 08:44 - James Kemp: I imagine we‚Äôll see them next week lool
10/03/2022, 08:45 - Aaron Ayling: Do we stick with the same team name?
10/03/2022, 08:45 - James Kemp: I think we have to?!
10/03/2022, 08:45 - James Kemp: Build the brand
10/03/2022, 09:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Which was what?
10/03/2022, 09:42 - James Kemp: Is Anybody Watching The New Series of The Apprentice?
10/03/2022, 09:43 - James Kemp: (None of us are)
10/03/2022, 09:48 - Reuben Yarwood: I don't get it
10/03/2022, 09:58 - James Kemp: Nothing to get
10/03/2022, 09:58 - James Kemp: Just curious if anyone‚Äôs watching it
10/03/2022, 10:12 - Aaron Ayling: So because of Russian sanctions (and Chelsea being owned by an oligarch) apparently Chelsea aren't allowed to sell tickets to their games.
10/03/2022, 10:12 - Aaron Ayling: Only season ticket holders will be allowed entry. No away fans etc.

Would be such a weird atmosphere.
10/03/2022, 10:14 - +44 7462 872590: Chelsea have 28,000 season ticket holders out of their 41,837 capacity.
10/03/2022, 10:15 - Aaron Ayling: Ah well never mind then
10/03/2022, 10:15 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah gonna be such a weird atmosphere with half an empty stadium
10/03/2022, 10:15 - Aaron Ayling: Still more than I was expecting!
10/03/2022, 10:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Didn't he pass on ownership to the club or some other loophole?
10/03/2022, 10:24 - +44 7462 872590: They tried to classify the club as a charity üôÑ. But that wasn't allowed. Roman still owns the Chelsea, he tried to sell it last week but couldn't get a bid together in time. Now he can't sell it under the sanctions.
10/03/2022, 10:25 - +44 7462 872590: So Chelsea football club is still his assets... And his assets have been frozen by the UK government
10/03/2022, 10:28 - +44 7462 872590: He can't sell the club, most of the revenue streams for the club have been cut off, they can't buy or sell players or offer new contracts to players (serval of their best player's contacts run out in the summer and at the moment Chelsea can't renew them). Pretty devastating for Chelsea FC.
10/03/2022, 10:28 - Aaron Ayling: This is super interesting
10/03/2022, 10:29 - Aaron Ayling: What do you think will happen? I guess that hinges on whether sanctions lift soon?
10/03/2022, 10:29 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah, I think they will let him sell the club sometime soon.
10/03/2022, 10:29 - Reuben Yarwood: V informative cheers man!
10/03/2022, 10:30 - Reuben Yarwood: #FootballFan

10/03/2022, 10:30 - +44 7462 872590: It will be interesting the pressure from Chelsea fans on the govt.
10/03/2022, 10:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Once again - as Jim said - so interesting seeing these repercussions of war
10/03/2022, 10:31 - +44 7462 872590: The same fans that chanted Roman Abramovich's name during the minute silence for Ukraine.
10/03/2022, 10:32 - +44 7462 872590: Not all Chelsea fans... But a noticeable amount
10/03/2022, 10:34 - +44 7462 872590: This is what you get when you let Russian oligarchs (and oil rich Middle Eastern states) buy prize community assets I guess.

10/03/2022, 10:37 - +61 474 759 280: Because of course it is
10/03/2022, 10:42 - Aaron Ayling: Also I have been asked to submit a picture of a famous person wearing an interesting/weird hat, as part of a quiz round for a discord server I'm in.

If you have any suggestions let me know

20/03/2022, 10:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Hey pals. So we found this holiday house in Brittany through the East Dulwich Facebook group. They've just started renting it out again after covid so it's free most of the summer. Would anyone be interested in a wee France stay in the summer? It's super cheap, I think ¬£175 for a week then cleaning costs:

20/03/2022, 10:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Only six beds but there's a big garden and they've said we could take a tent if more people want to stay.
20/03/2022, 10:14 - Aaron Ayling: So I would love love love to do a cabinny situation with you lot this summer before we go away forever (which is looking increasingly likely it'll be August but we'll confirm ASAP when we know).

Not ruling this one out per se but feel like there may be slightly better options for not too much more money? Very happy to be overruled  (Liz and I are 100% not camping haha) Would also want to know where in Brittany and how we'd get there etc etc.

But yes, very much would like this sort of vibe this summer, even if its in this country or whatever.
20/03/2022, 10:15 - Aaron Ayling: Liz is happy to do some research when she's got some downtime while she's in the US next week too
20/03/2022, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: So the place is called Kermorleven. I thought we could perhaps get the train down to the coast and get a ferry over then rent a car in France. It's about an hour and a half drive on the other side.
20/03/2022, 10:18 - Reuben Yarwood: There are deffo better options but I think a lot of them will be booked up already and probably a lot more ¬£¬£¬£. Throwing this one out there as it's not ideal but it's v flexible!
20/03/2022, 10:19 - Reuben Yarwood: But yeah I'd love a trip like this and very happy to do it anywhere else if we can find something!
20/03/2022, 10:22 - Sam Lea: Are we deffo ruling out the Eurovision semifinals? Tickets still yet to be sold, though I imagine we'd want to get looking at accommodation asap as it's likely going to be very booked up already
20/03/2022, 10:23 - Reuben Yarwood: Would also be 1000% down for this
20/03/2022, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: Was it ¬£175 for the whole cabin for a week? Would you (Slash anyone) be cool if Liz and I paid for the whole thing as a treat but then we get the bed (this may be cheeky feel free to reject this). Liz says she could also drive in France as its on the right
20/03/2022, 10:25 - Aaron Ayling: If its a choice between the two I'd rather a cabinny situation to spend more quality time with you all. Eurovision feels a tad stressful to me thinking about it in my current state but could also be talked around haha
20/03/2022, 10:26 - Sam Lea: Well... There's the question. _Is_ it a choice between the two...? üòâ
20/03/2022, 10:26 - Aaron Ayling: Anywho we're off for a walk from Ramsgate to Margate today so catch you all later x x x
20/03/2022, 10:46 - Edward Beesley: I'm keen for some sort of trip like this! That place you've sent looks good Reubs, although yes I suppose ideally spending a little bit more in order to get somewhere we can all have a _good sized bed_ might be preferable
20/03/2022, 10:47 - James Kemp: Would also be so totally down! And also like the idea of having a bed!

20/03/2022, 11:06 - +44 7752 359588: Nope
20/03/2022, 11:06 - +44 7752 359588: Mama's back in the us
20/03/2022, 11:06 - +44 7752 359588: This spoons is an old victorian pavilion/arcade
20/03/2022, 11:06 - +44 7752 359588: Great sea views from the balcony
20/03/2022, 11:13 - Aaron Ayling: Liz will have a research about cabins next week when she's in the US btw. We'll be very flexible on dates (anytime late May or June/July) so just let us know when works. Or if you have any specific requests besides "beds". 

I reckon if we have some drivers (ed/Reuben/sam/Liz if we're in Europe?) we'll have no bother finding somewhere decent with availability.
20/03/2022, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Ooh enjoy!
20/03/2022, 11:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah the whole week! But no rush, as it's not getting booked up. Happy to go anywhere really if we can find something with more beds.
20/03/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: My whole summer has a pretty wide open bar a week at the end of June, so super flexible!
20/03/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: Sorry I can‚Äôt contribute as a driver - pretty traumatized from recent driving experiences (aka accidentally running away from the police), but happy to disproportionately contribute some other way!!
20/03/2022, 11:21 - James Kemp: *is pretty wide open
20/03/2022, 11:36 - +44 7462 872590: I'm also very keen for a trip. I'm easy with whatever.

22/03/2022, 11:03 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh hope this is fun!

22/03/2022, 11:05 - Edward Beesley: Happy to do a different week for the tab spend!
22/03/2022, 11:05 - James Kemp: Nah mate it‚Äôs good!

22/03/2022, 11:05 - James Kemp: (At least on my share)
22/03/2022, 11:06 - James Kemp: Don‚Äôt wanna speak for others üòÖ
22/03/2022, 11:10 - Sam Lea: What's the latest we can leave the bar tab? Did they say how long we had to come back and claim it?
22/03/2022, 11:15 - Aaron Ayling: Liz and I will be quizzing tomorrow. I demand my ¬£12 prize money
22/03/2022, 11:22 - James Kemp: Praying for you that that silly bitch is no longer quizmaster
22/03/2022, 11:22 - James Kemp: (Slash did we win because of her?)
22/03/2022, 11:38 - Edward Beesley: They didn't mention any expiry
22/03/2022, 11:38 - Edward Beesley: In answer to John's question, she was our MVP
22/03/2022, 11:39 - James Kemp: Ha!
22/03/2022, 12:25 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 12:26 - +44 7462 872590: That's not me and I've never even met Allegations
22/03/2022, 12:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Lord. Could this be a bit awkward in future job interviews?
22/03/2022, 12:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe add George Burgess (not the pervert) to your CV
22/03/2022, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: TiVo sponsored that GB to do that to trap our GB forever
22/03/2022, 12:35 - +44 7462 872590: Not the pervert mentioned in these articles anyway.
22/03/2022, 12:36 - +44 7462 872590: Also we are the same age and both English and lived/lives in Australia
22/03/2022, 12:36 - James Kemp: Change your name
22/03/2022, 12:36 - James Kemp: Let‚Äôs group ouija your new one
22/03/2022, 12:37 - +44 7462 872590: K-E-V-I-N S-P-A-C-E-Y üò† God damn it

22/03/2022, 12:39 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 12:39 - James Kemp: I don‚Äôt know how many days it‚Äôs been, I just know I‚Äôm two down
22/03/2022, 12:40 - James Kemp: @447940330084 no idea how you‚Äôve lived with parents this long
22/03/2022, 13:08 - +44 7752 359588: At least the puzzles are pretty!
22/03/2022, 13:08 - +44 7752 359588: PRINCE ANDREW
22/03/2022, 13:09 - +44 7462 872590: I'll go with just Prince (The man formally known as George Burgess)
22/03/2022, 13:26 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
22/03/2022, 13:26 - +44 7752 359588: Literally the only pub open at 1 on a Tuesday
22/03/2022, 13:29 - Sam Lea: Lunchtime pint?
22/03/2022, 13:29 - Sam Lea: What an inspired idea
22/03/2022, 13:30 - +44 7752 359588: Gotta catch those rays
22/03/2022, 13:30 - +44 7752 359588: Chicago is looking cold and grim
22/03/2022, 13:50 - Aaron Ayling: Just got this spam email:

Banana is a word that has more than one meaning. It can either mean the yellow fruit, or it can mean for example the dance banana. I wonder if you know which of these words I was thinking of in my headline? Guess you're thinking about the yellow fruit and that you could insert in me? Then it‚Äôs like I thought, hihi. So where do you think we could place the banana? There are three holes to choose from, and it can only be in one of them at a time, right? It would be really nice to get it in the butt. I know I would like that. A banana in the butt and fingers in the pussy might be something?
22/03/2022, 13:51 - Sam Lea: might be something? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
22/03/2022, 14:03 - James Kemp: Keep that edible shit out of my holes thank you
22/03/2022, 14:06 - +44 7752 359588: Also... Get three bananas... Insert in all three holes...
22/03/2022, 20:13 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
22/03/2022, 20:13 - +61 474 759 280: Takes me back
22/03/2022, 20:28 - +44 7752 359588: They were playing that Rob Thomas/Santana song, which feels particularly appropriate
22/03/2022, 20:28 - +44 7752 359588: (and also other bangers)
22/03/2022, 21:02 - +61 474 759 280: The dream
22/03/2022, 21:02 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
23/03/2022, 09:55 - James Kemp: This is a v cheeky request, but any of you strapping south London lads around on Sat 2nd to potentially help Dani and I lift a few boxes into our new pad??
23/03/2022, 09:56 - James Kemp: We will repay you with copious amounts of pizza and beer and whatever else if so!
23/03/2022, 09:59 - Sam Lea: I'm up in Manchester overnight for a work do on the Friday evening, won't be back in London til late afternoon / early evening on Sat - will you be doing any moving on the Sunday?
23/03/2022, 10:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah boi
23/03/2022, 11:36 - James Kemp: Hopefully we‚Äôll be all in on Sat!!
23/03/2022, 11:36 - James Kemp: That‚Äôd be amazing - thank you so much, mate!!
23/03/2022, 11:39 - Aaron Ayling: I am getting (another) MMR and TDaP vaccine on that day as NHS has lost my childhood vaccine records and I need em for the US Visa.
23/03/2022, 11:39 - James Kemp: As if they lost them?!
23/03/2022, 11:40 - Reuben Yarwood: Jeez
23/03/2022, 11:40 - Aaron Ayling: Well it's before computers and I've moved around the country and changed GPs so much etc etc
23/03/2022, 11:41 - Reuben Yarwood: Jim have you been in your new place yet?
23/03/2022, 11:41 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm pumped to see it!
23/03/2022, 11:41 - James Kemp: I STILL HAVEN‚ÄôT
23/03/2022, 11:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Lol
23/03/2022, 11:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Love that you signed a 3 year lease as well
23/03/2022, 11:42 - James Kemp: We went back to the cafe opposite on Sat before we saw y‚Äôall tho and it seems like a bit of a queer hub
23/03/2022, 11:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh no way?
23/03/2022, 11:42 - James Kemp: The lesbian who works there remembered us!
23/03/2022, 11:42 - Reuben Yarwood: That's so fun!
23/03/2022, 11:42 - James Kemp: So gonna try and use her to infiltrate the Dulwich queer scene üòà
23/03/2022, 11:43 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm picturing lots of wine and cheese and local goss
23/03/2022, 11:43 - James Kemp: Or poor jaded creatives living off their parents‚Äô wealth?
23/03/2022, 11:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Porque no los dos?
23/03/2022, 11:44 - Reuben Yarwood: That cheese ain't cheap
23/03/2022, 15:37 - Aaron Ayling: Just handed my notice in!
23/03/2022, 15:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Hot damn!
23/03/2022, 15:38 - Aaron Ayling: It's like 99% certain I'll have a greencard and we'll be free to leave by the end of April. Just got some movement this week
23/03/2022, 15:38 - Aaron Ayling: We're eyeing up an actual leaving date of beginning ish of August
23/03/2022, 15:39 - Reuben Yarwood: So soon!
23/03/2022, 15:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Congrats man, we'll have to get some fun plans booked in!
23/03/2022, 15:51 - James Kemp: BIG !
23/03/2022, 15:52 - Reuben Yarwood: What's your notice period?
23/03/2022, 15:53 - James Kemp: And how does it feel?!
23/03/2022, 15:54 - James Kemp: Are you feeling hella ready with how long it‚Äôs been and how BLEH the past few years have been??
23/03/2022, 16:01 - Aaron Ayling: 1 month, but I'll have my last day as 28th April
23/03/2022, 16:05 - Aaron Ayling: And yeah! Good! A Relief to finally feel like there's some certainty/control of life again
23/03/2022, 16:05 - Aaron Ayling: I think it's been more the length of the process rather than Covid being shit that has got to me
23/03/2022, 16:06 - Aaron Ayling: just feeling like life's been on hold (which I suppose Covid did contribute to as well eh)
23/03/2022, 17:11 - Sam Lea: What time we quizzin'?
23/03/2022, 17:26 - Reuben Yarwood: Also - drinks this weekend?

23/03/2022, 21:31 - +61 474 759 280: Very envious at the prospect of having a new country on the horizon
23/03/2022, 21:32 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
23/03/2022, 22:07 - Aaron Ayling: WE FUCKING DID IT AGAIN!
23/03/2022, 22:19 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
23/03/2022, 22:20 - +61 474 759 280: Ahahahha congrats!
23/03/2022, 22:20 - +61 474 759 280: What are these hieroglyphs to the left
23/03/2022, 22:20 - +61 474 759 280: MVP?
23/03/2022, 22:48 - James Kemp: NO WAY
23/03/2022, 22:50 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
23/03/2022, 22:52 - Aaron Ayling: Tonight was a real genuine "everyone had a good contribution" night!

23/03/2022, 22:55 - Aaron Ayling: But I was very proud of nabbing us 3 bonus points for being the first team to guess the link for the round 3 questions after just the first 2 questions.
23/03/2022, 23:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Rex Harrison
Barbie Girl
23/03/2022, 23:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Guess the link
23/03/2022, 23:13 - James Kemp: Omg well done guys!!
23/03/2022, 23:13 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
24/03/2022, 01:18 - Sam Lea: you betta respond to her work emails!
24/03/2022, 08:33 - +44 7752 359588: Agh that's sick!
24/03/2022, 09:06 - Sam Lea: Who is she?
24/03/2022, 09:07 - Aaron Ayling: #girlboss
24/03/2022, 09:43 - James Kemp: I had no idea and one of my colleagues was like ‚Äògoogle her name‚Äô üåö
24/03/2022, 09:44 - Aaron Ayling: That is pretty cool
24/03/2022, 09:44 - James Kemp: Idk if it‚Äôs still her vibe
24/03/2022, 09:44 - James Kemp: We‚Äôre going out on Fri so will try and subtly get her to bring it up
24/03/2022, 09:44 - James Kemp: Also WELL DONE again on being reigning champs?!
24/03/2022, 09:46 - Aaron Ayling: Thanks! Champions league is April 7th btw. Venue tbc (we have a choice of 3 and it'll be broadcast live to all of em)
24/03/2022, 09:46 - Aaron Ayling: First place is ¬£1000
24/03/2022, 09:46 - Aaron Ayling: We've got no chance but it'll be a laugh!
24/03/2022, 09:47 - +61 474 759 280: Whaaaaat
24/03/2022, 09:48 - Aaron Ayling: The guys that put the quiz on invite the winners to a seasonal champion league. So it's just the winners of their quizzes competing.
24/03/2022, 09:48 - +61 474 759 280: And they broadcast it for the other pubs???
24/03/2022, 09:48 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs wild
24/03/2022, 09:48 - Aaron Ayling: And thanks! Yeah I'm quite looking forward to having another country in my future tbh.
24/03/2022, 09:49 - Aaron Ayling: yeah, so we're all competing at the same time I guess.
24/03/2022, 09:49 - +61 474 759 280: Oooooh lol
24/03/2022, 09:50 - +61 474 759 280: I had it in my head all the teams would play at one pub, and it was broadcast at the other pubs just for the fans
24/03/2022, 09:50 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs been a long day
24/03/2022, 09:51 - Aaron Ayling: Haha all the supporters turning up in "Quizlamic Extremists" "Let's get quizzacle" and "Steven hawking's football boots" shirts.
24/03/2022, 09:55 - James Kemp: Ooooooh!!
24/03/2022, 10:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Announcement for Ella's book is out
24/03/2022, 10:15 - Reuben Yarwood: https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/wn-wins-bucknalls-captivating-graphic-virginia-woolf-biography-in-three-way-auction
24/03/2022, 10:15 - +44 7752 359588: AHHHH THATS SO COOL
24/03/2022, 10:15 - +44 7752 359588: Also love this headshot of her - she looks so serious and cool
24/03/2022, 10:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Such a good photo. Her friend did it. Tempted to hire her for a photo shoot for no particular reason. Just for some sick photos.
24/03/2022, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Are you still at the airport Lizzo?
24/03/2022, 10:17 - +44 7752 359588: Yep!
24/03/2022, 10:17 - +44 7752 359588: Hellscape per usual
24/03/2022, 10:17 - Reuben Yarwood: Godspeed
24/03/2022, 10:17 - +44 7752 359588: Man all the quotes about the book are so nice too, she must be buzzing! And international rights too
24/03/2022, 10:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah they're so gushy!
24/03/2022, 10:20 - Sam Lea: Unbelievably cool, huge congrats to her!
24/03/2022, 10:21 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôll buy the Australian edition and share here in 2024 üôè
24/03/2022, 10:21 - Aaron Ayling: Also didn't realise that that gurl spells her name "Lettice" which is way more of a name than "Lettuce" (what I was assuming it was)
24/03/2022, 10:22 - +44 7752 359588: I mean it's more of a name? But also just seems like a wanky spelling of lettuce
24/03/2022, 10:23 - Aaron Ayling: Like Letticia I suppose
24/03/2022, 10:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah I think this is it
24/03/2022, 10:52 - James Kemp: Omggggg
24/03/2022, 10:52 - James Kemp: Slayyyyy
24/03/2022, 10:53 - James Kemp: This is so cool!
24/03/2022, 11:19 - +44 7462 872590: This is so cool! Congrats!!
24/03/2022, 11:37 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
24/03/2022, 11:42 - Aaron Ayling: could have triple parked before 12pm
24/03/2022, 11:42 - +44 7752 359588: True
24/03/2022, 11:42 - +44 7752 359588: But if I need to fight the hordes if the flight is cancelled, I need to be not completely wasted
24/03/2022, 11:43 - James Kemp: Or you need to be completely wasted
24/03/2022, 11:43 - James Kemp: Unleash fighty Liz
24/03/2022, 11:43 - +44 7752 359588: Just yelling at the BA desk agent: PLAY COUNTRY ROADS YOU CUNTZZ
24/03/2022, 11:43 - Aaron Ayling: Plane country roads
24/03/2022, 11:47 - Reuben Yarwood: RIP
24/03/2022, 11:47 - Reuben Yarwood: üòÇ
24/03/2022, 11:48 - James Kemp: This is the viral video I need to see
24/03/2022, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: Doing a bit of cottage dabbling from the airport, and I guess the question I have is: do people want to be in-country or somewhere in Europe? And if Europe, how far away?
24/03/2022, 12:12 - +44 7752 359588: If we stay in the UK, there are some nice places (mostly in Wales), and obviously we could just drive
24/03/2022, 12:12 - +44 7752 359588: But you do get more bang for your buck in Europe, although you'd have to factor in flights/car rentals depending on where
24/03/2022, 12:13 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm pretty location agnostic personally!
24/03/2022, 12:13 - James Kemp: Bigger factor for me is ¬£¬£¬£¬£
24/03/2022, 12:13 - James Kemp: Not sure about others?!
24/03/2022, 12:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Yep agreed
24/03/2022, 12:15 - +44 7752 359588: Do you have a budget in mind? I've been looking at places in the UK that were up to ¬£150/per person for a week
24/03/2022, 12:15 - James Kemp: Aware this narrows nothing down
24/03/2022, 12:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds doable!
24/03/2022, 12:15 - James Kemp: That sounds super reasonable yeah!
24/03/2022, 12:16 - +44 7752 359588: I was trying to keep it cheap, if you wanted to go higher, obviously also could
24/03/2022, 12:16 - James Kemp: Dani‚Äôs likely to be pinging back and forth to Italy as his brother‚Äôs moving next month, so he might be out
24/03/2022, 12:16 - +44 7752 359588: Tbh there are some banging places in Italy, but I imagine when you factor in flights and car rental it probably isn't much cheaper
24/03/2022, 12:16 - James Kemp: But I am fully in!
24/03/2022, 12:16 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh this is exciting!
24/03/2022, 12:17 - +44 7752 359588: Also open to other directives - have primarily been looking at places where there are no neighbors
24/03/2022, 12:17 - Aaron Ayling: I would fancy a road trip type deal with y'all, so I would maybe fancy staying in the UK? This also makes it less scary to take drugs with (if we fancied that etc etc)
24/03/2022, 12:17 - +44 7752 359588: Will do some actual google mapping
24/03/2022, 12:17 - Aaron Ayling: thanks for looking Liz x x x
24/03/2022, 12:17 - Sam Lea: @447940330084 had some interesting suggestions
24/03/2022, 12:17 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd personally be fine going up of this, but happy to keep 150 as target if it works for others?
24/03/2022, 12:17 - +44 7752 359588: But I would say if we stay in the UK, brace yourself for Wales
24/03/2022, 12:17 - James Kemp: Am down!
24/03/2022, 12:18 - Sam Lea: something something extremely cheap yet nice place on Lake Bled?
24/03/2022, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: (sorry @447462872590 , there are some nice looking places in Snowdonia)
24/03/2022, 12:18 - +44 7752 359588: I am also extremely open to someone else chucking in suggestions - I also hate planning holidays üòÇ
24/03/2022, 12:18 - Sam Lea: Obviously Cornwall is very oversubscribed, but if we could get somewhere like, for example, Port Isaac, that's reliably extremely bloody lovely
24/03/2022, 12:19 - +44 7752 359588: Babe I don't think we can afford cornwall
24/03/2022, 12:19 - Sam Lea: Lol
24/03/2022, 12:19 - +44 7752 359588: Could barely afford the peak district
24/03/2022, 12:19 - James Kemp: Oh is she ¬£¬£¬£¬£?
24/03/2022, 12:19 - James Kemp: Fuck that pricey bitch
24/03/2022, 12:19 - +44 7752 359588: I think it's a combo of ¬£¬£¬£ and also booked up
24/03/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: I like the idea of random slightly off the map Wales?
24/03/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: What about Scotland?
24/03/2022, 12:20 - +44 7752 359588: She also isn't giving me much, but will keep looking
24/03/2022, 12:20 - Aaron Ayling: i like this too
24/03/2022, 12:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Thanks for looking Liz, I hate holiday planning too!
24/03/2022, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: If people are comfortable bumping higher on prices (maybe ¬£200 pp?) Might help
24/03/2022, 12:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Anglesey is lovely and lots of nice beaches
24/03/2022, 12:21 - James Kemp: If we can agree a rough brief, happy to share the load, Liz!
24/03/2022, 12:21 - Aaron Ayling: fine for me
24/03/2022, 12:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Although it's quite a drive from LDN
24/03/2022, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: Would also be good to be firm on numbers for this math
24/03/2022, 12:21 - Aaron Ayling: ROAD TRIP
24/03/2022, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: Realize that probably depends on dates
24/03/2022, 12:21 - James Kemp: ¬£200 fine for me!
24/03/2022, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Where even is this lol?
24/03/2022, 12:22 - Reuben Yarwood: I could do 200
24/03/2022, 12:22 - Reuben Yarwood: It's an island off the north of Wales
24/03/2022, 12:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Charlie and Megan (Mads' pals) are getting married there next year
24/03/2022, 12:22 - Sam Lea: Haven't been to Anglesey in a long time but from what I can remember yeah, it's noice!
24/03/2022, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: I have been calculating based on 10 people (Reuben, Ella, Jim, Dani (will now possibly discount), Sam, George, Ed, Cesca, Aaron, Me)
24/03/2022, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: So if we're dropping down, will obviously impact cost
24/03/2022, 12:23 - James Kemp: Yeah I‚Äôll extract a firm answer from him tonight!
24/03/2022, 12:24 - +44 7752 359588: Basically everyone corral your boos and lmk
24/03/2022, 12:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Me and Ella stayed on this beach (in the van) and it was lovely
24/03/2022, 12:25 - Reuben Yarwood: https://www.visitwales.com/attraction/beach/llanddwyn-beach-1821332
24/03/2022, 12:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Could do a day trip up Snowdon
24/03/2022, 12:26 - Reuben Yarwood: (soz George)
24/03/2022, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: that does sound nice!
24/03/2022, 12:26 - Reuben Yarwood: South Coast would obviously be more accessible from London
24/03/2022, 12:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Eg Pembrokeshire
24/03/2022, 12:27 - Edward Beesley: Yeh my thinking was that I've heard good things about the likes of Montenegro (visitmontenegro.me). Or Croatia or Slovenia. Did a very cursory Airbnb search the other day and saw fairly luxurious (if a bit Love Islandy) villas that would work out at about ¬£20-25 per night per person. But obviously then flights on top of that - but they could be quite affordable if we're doing it "out of season". I guess we need to figure out when is a set of dates we can all do and look at prices based on that?
24/03/2022, 12:27 - James Kemp: Ed comes in with the wildcard
24/03/2022, 12:28 - Edward Beesley: Nice big houses with swimming pools, by lakes/the sea
24/03/2022, 12:28 - James Kemp: Wales, Pembrokeshire‚Ä¶ SLOVENIA
24/03/2022, 12:28 - Aaron Ayling: I would say to get things going look in June?
24/03/2022, 12:28 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm annoyingly out 18th - 25th June
24/03/2022, 12:28 - Edward Beesley: Lake Bled, Slovenia. Can be very idyllic and reasonable I've heard!
24/03/2022, 12:28 - James Kemp: So might prefer July?
24/03/2022, 12:28 - Reuben Yarwood: I've been. V pretty
24/03/2022, 12:29 - Sam Lea: When were you there, Reubs?
24/03/2022, 12:29 - Reuben Yarwood: 2008
24/03/2022, 12:29 - Aaron Ayling: I'm doing it, I'm making a fucking doodle
24/03/2022, 12:29 - Aaron Ayling: here we go
24/03/2022, 12:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Interrailing
24/03/2022, 12:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Yes Aaron! Good shout.
24/03/2022, 12:29 - James Kemp: Do iiiiiiiit
24/03/2022, 12:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Will fill in this eve
24/03/2022, 12:30 - +44 7752 359588: Yesssss
24/03/2022, 12:30 - James Kemp: Those dates above are when Dani and I are in Italy, but that‚Äôs my only commitment this summer so otherwise pretty flex!
24/03/2022, 12:30 - James Kemp: (Aka I promise I won‚Äôt be too difficult)
24/03/2022, 12:31 - +44 7752 359588: I mean we are loose and breezy, just fucking off in August
24/03/2022, 12:31 - James Kemp: Also I‚Äôll google the price of flights from Melbourne
24/03/2022, 12:31 - Reuben Yarwood: BTW 
Pembrokeshire: 5 hr 15 drive
Anglesey: 6hr drive
Not a huge difference
24/03/2022, 12:31 - James Kemp: ü•≤
24/03/2022, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah johnny come on, it's only what? A 14 hour flight?
24/03/2022, 12:32 - +44 7752 359588: Plus a 6 hour drive
24/03/2022, 12:33 - James Kemp: ü•∫
24/03/2022, 12:33 - Aaron Ayling: This message was deleted
24/03/2022, 12:35 - Aaron Ayling: only went up to July 16th but can deffo do a few days after that - if you click July 16th assume that's a leaving date
24/03/2022, 12:36 - Aaron Ayling: https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/Le35wBpb
24/03/2022, 12:36 - Aaron Ayling: Wrong link before I'm a boomer
24/03/2022, 12:41 - Aaron Ayling: also managed to edit this so have put in up to end of July, fill in as usual x x x
24/03/2022, 12:43 - James Kemp: Need a midday hungover nap, will fill in ASAP when I‚Äôm alive!
24/03/2022, 14:27 - +44 7462 872590: üíÄI would not be keen on a North Wales trip to be honest.

24/03/2022, 14:31 - James Kemp: Beautiful
24/03/2022, 14:31 - James Kemp: I will engage this evening!!
24/03/2022, 14:31 - James Kemp: Does this mean you‚Äôre still awaiting your flight, Liz?
24/03/2022, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: Yep
24/03/2022, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: Only starting to board now
24/03/2022, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: The search can be widened, but this is my contributing start
24/03/2022, 14:33 - +44 7752 359588: I made a wishlist: group stay! Check out my top picks on Airbnb. https://www.airbnb.com/wishlists/1072616876?s=13
24/03/2022, 14:34 - +44 7752 359588: You can also go via the Airbnb list
24/03/2022, 14:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Liz you're an absolute star
24/03/2022, 14:35 - +44 7752 359588: You should be able to straight up access the spreadsheet, let me know if not, since I'll be on a plane soon ish
24/03/2022, 14:36 - +44 7752 359588: Wait new link

24/03/2022, 14:37 - +44 7462 872590: So if we are thinking about Wales and Snowdonia area... My parents do run a bed and breakfast there so could try an organise a time when it's free. Probably would be not peak summer season. But I'll ask them when's best.
24/03/2022, 14:39 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I am not attached to Wales, it just has cheap stuff
24/03/2022, 14:39 - +44 7752 359588: Not sure how wastey we can get round your parents?
24/03/2022, 14:40 - +44 7752 359588: Does your mum want to do shots with me?
24/03/2022, 14:41 - +44 7462 872590: Probably... But yes we probably could get fully mashed with the folks
24/03/2022, 14:44 - +44 7462 872590: *couldn't
24/03/2022, 14:44 - +44 7462 872590: **pretty important difference
24/03/2022, 14:52 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe
24/03/2022, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: Also y'all should be able to edit if you want to add things
24/03/2022, 15:04 - Edward Beesley: If we're doing UK: Lake District might have some good options too? Long drive but not longer than some of the Wales options I think
24/03/2022, 15:04 - Edward Beesley: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/45390651?check_in=2022-05-14&check_out=2022-05-21&guests=1&adults=7&s=67&unique_share_id=dbebad50-cd36-4bf1-96d7-f63d8ef2b6c8

24/03/2022, 15:06 - Edward Beesley: (ok)
24/03/2022, 15:07 - +44 7462 872590: How many of us are there. Just noticed that one of the places was a 4 bed (8 person) place Ed? Assuming we'd need bigger than that
24/03/2022, 15:09 - Edward Beesley: Yeh they might not be suitable, was just sending to give a flavour of the sort of thing we could get if we went somewhere cheap and sunny in Europe
24/03/2022, 15:13 - +44 7752 359588: I think a couple of mine are also 4 beds, but noted - they could be good if we end up with a couple drops
24/03/2022, 15:14 - Aaron Ayling: Down with the general flavour of wherever and could be down, but would need harder facts re: actual places to stay and costs of flights. Basically, without sounding like too much of a dick, if anyone wants a specific place please do the legwork.
24/03/2022, 15:14 - +44 7752 359588: I'll have a scope of VRBO for the UK too - I've gotten a couple solid rentals there before
24/03/2022, 15:20 - +44 7752 359588: Literally still sitting on the tarmac, but it's looking likely I'll be getting some of that sweet sweet delayed flight compensation ü§û
24/03/2022, 15:22 - Aaron Ayling: could be ¬£520 from a quick google if you're delayed 4 hours or more
24/03/2022, 15:22 - +44 7752 359588: You know what, I'll take it
24/03/2022, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Should have grabbed another spoons pint if I have that kind of cash coming my way
24/03/2022, 16:33 - James Kemp: Godspeed, Lizzard!!
24/03/2022, 16:33 - James Kemp: This work day has felt like it‚Äôs lasted three years I am _toasted_
24/03/2022, 16:33 - James Kemp: Dusty and crusty af
24/03/2022, 16:34 - Aaron Ayling: Well done on making it to the end
24/03/2022, 16:34 - Aaron Ayling: My notice is in so I am in ultimate dgaf mode
24/03/2022, 16:34 - James Kemp: How long‚Äôs your notice period? 1 month?
24/03/2022, 16:35 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah but giving em til April 28th
24/03/2022, 16:35 - Aaron Ayling: Extra week to be nice
24/03/2022, 16:35 - James Kemp: So kind!
24/03/2022, 18:24 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
24/03/2022, 18:25 - +61 474 759 280: Have never been conscious of it until now
24/03/2022, 18:42 - Sam Lea: wwg1wga
24/03/2022, 21:33 - James Kemp: i have filled in the doodle!
24/03/2022, 21:33 - James Kemp: and confirmed with dani - he's (sadly) not going to join us this time; saving his pennies for what could be multiple italy trips!
25/03/2022, 00:51 - +44 7752 359588: A man from my flight is throwing a bitch fit at his friend because the weed dispensary is going to be closed by the time they get out of the airport
25/03/2022, 00:51 - +44 7752 359588: Welcome back to America
25/03/2022, 00:51 - +44 7752 359588: He also threatened these schwasted Brits who I believe may have been chatting shit about the US
25/03/2022, 00:52 - +44 7752 359588: I think in an attempt to assuage the passengers, the stewards over served
25/03/2022, 00:54 - +44 7752 359588: And then the line brought them back together and the Brit started mouthing off. Peak shit macho posturing. Waiting for some fisticuffs by the baggage claim
25/03/2022, 00:55 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs still kicking on???
25/03/2022, 00:55 - +61 474 759 280: What are they arguing about?
25/03/2022, 00:57 - +61 474 759 280: Love that they are blissfully  unaware this is getting beamed back to the UK and Australia
25/03/2022, 00:58 - +61 474 759 280: Somewhere in Melbourne, a Stowellman sits on the edge of his seat, waiting for an update of the big fight üçø
25/03/2022, 01:01 - +44 7752 359588: I'm not sure?
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +44 7752 359588: It then devolved into the American yelling "you got 20 pounds mate" in a truly appalling British accent
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +44 7752 359588: And then someone called security
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +61 474 759 280: Hahahaha
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +44 7752 359588: American got a talking to, he seems to have simmered down
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +44 7752 359588: His friend is clearly dying of embarrassment
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +61 474 759 280: I like the idea that this was what triggered calling security
25/03/2022, 01:02 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúENOUGH‚Äù
25/03/2022, 01:03 - +44 7752 359588: Told him to calm down - the response: "you're the one who is wanted to fly with me"
25/03/2022, 01:04 - +61 474 759 280: LOL
25/03/2022, 01:04 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh I think they just got fast tracked through the line because he was still kicking off
25/03/2022, 01:04 - +44 7752 359588: Too far away to be nosy
25/03/2022, 01:04 - +44 7752 359588: But I'm trying
25/03/2022, 01:05 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe I should threaten to bash a guys skull in
25/03/2022, 01:05 - +44 7752 359588: This line is long
25/03/2022, 07:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Done! Pretty much free except the Lambeth Country Show on July 16th-17th
25/03/2022, 07:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Happy to have a look at places this weekend. I'll look into prices for the ferry/car hire for the Brittany place too (and we take a blow up bed)
25/03/2022, 08:06 - +61 474 759 280: For the love of god don‚Äôt make George go back to Wales
25/03/2022, 08:06 - +61 474 759 280: You sickos
25/03/2022, 08:21 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 08:24 - +44 7462 872590: I didn't believe in ghosts before living in Wales. Now I genuinely believe there's a 30% chance an evil force is pulling me back there and I'll never be able to leave. And also I've done most of the walks.
25/03/2022, 08:29 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 09:06 - James Kemp: I can also do some research!
25/03/2022, 09:07 - James Kemp: Maybe we all do the Doodle so we can settle on dates first?
25/03/2022, 09:07 - James Kemp: Aka roll up, roll up those who haven‚Äôt done it yet! ü§°
25/03/2022, 09:41 - Sam Lea: Honk honk - yes sorry, will fill this out on my lunch today
25/03/2022, 11:39 - Edward Beesley: I've done mine. Haven't had a chance to speak to Cesca properly about it yet so my availability is just for me so far
25/03/2022, 11:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Ella's is similar to mine, minus a few days. But she will possibly just come for a weekend?
25/03/2022, 11:52 - +44 7462 872590: Done the Doodle
25/03/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: So currently
25/03/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs looking like early May or early July?
25/03/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: If we do end up with a choice, I‚Äôd vote early July just for those good summer vibes?
25/03/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: What do others think??
25/03/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: Might be getting ahead of myself here as not sure we‚Äôve all filled it in!
25/03/2022, 12:01 - Reuben Yarwood: I feel like May is often sunnier than July?
25/03/2022, 12:02 - Edward Beesley: I'd probably vote May on the basis that:
Looks like we're all more available then
Prices are likely to better
May is nice
25/03/2022, 12:02 - Edward Beesley: But yes, possibly premature until we've all Doodled
25/03/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: Happy to be swayed if everyone feels the same
25/03/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: And I only picked times when we were currently all available
25/03/2022, 12:03 - James Kemp: So I do NOT accept that argument, Edward
25/03/2022, 12:03 - James Kemp: But accept all the others!
25/03/2022, 12:04 - James Kemp: Maybe let‚Äôs take a final read when Sam‚Äôs input?
25/03/2022, 12:04 - James Kemp: Think it‚Äôs just him outstanding? (Genuinely no pressure, lad lol)
25/03/2022, 12:06 - Sam Lea: ‚òùÔ∏è
25/03/2022, 12:06 - James Kemp: ‚ù§Ô∏è
25/03/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: Okay dear friends
25/03/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: Unless I‚Äôve miscalculated, we‚Äôve all done the doodle now?
25/03/2022, 13:42 - James Kemp: And it remains a choice between early May and early July?
25/03/2022, 13:42 - James Kemp: Think the fairest way is we all just cast a vote for preference
25/03/2022, 13:42 - James Kemp: 1 vote each, for either May or July; there‚Äôs 7 of us so can‚Äôt tie
25/03/2022, 13:43 - James Kemp: I will start‚Ä¶

May - 0
July - 1
25/03/2022, 13:43 - James Kemp: üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
25/03/2022, 13:59 - +44 7462 872590: Can I be really annoying and say that both May and July work for me
25/03/2022, 13:59 - James Kemp: For now, yes
25/03/2022, 14:00 - +44 7462 872590: Hahahaha
25/03/2022, 14:00 - James Kemp: Might need to force you off the fence if it ties
25/03/2022, 14:00 - +44 7462 872590: Happy to bribed as the deciding vote
25/03/2022, 14:01 - James Kemp: üëåüèª
25/03/2022, 14:01 - +44 7462 872590: If it's the case that it's cheaper and there is more availability in May, then I'll lean towards May
25/03/2022, 14:01 - James Kemp: Fake news
25/03/2022, 14:01 - James Kemp: Don‚Äôt trust Ed
25/03/2022, 14:02 - James Kemp: But if that‚Äôs a vote for May, then 1-1!
25/03/2022, 14:08 - James Kemp: My reasons are:
- July is summer and summer is way better 
- May means going in like a month and I need more time?!
25/03/2022, 14:25 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I'd swing for July for more peak summer vibezzzz
25/03/2022, 14:26 - +44 7752 359588: Like Jim I also feel the short term planning crush
25/03/2022, 14:26 - +44 7752 359588: I also think you'd need to actually check prices, because the early may bank holiday probably means that the start of  may isn't much cheaper or more available
25/03/2022, 14:27 - +44 7462 872590: These are also very valid points
25/03/2022, 14:27 - James Kemp: Does that mean you‚Äôre back in the fence and it‚Äôs 2-0? üåù
25/03/2022, 14:28 - James Kemp: *on
25/03/2022, 14:28 - +44 7462 872590: Yup
25/03/2022, 14:29 - James Kemp: What are others thinking?
25/03/2022, 14:30 - James Kemp: I can see y‚Äôall seeing this üëÅ
25/03/2022, 14:33 - Aaron Ayling: July here
25/03/2022, 14:35 - James Kemp: So if Ed/Reubs, we take your prior votes, that means it‚Äôs currently 3-2 in favour of July
25/03/2022, 14:35 - James Kemp: With @447595390314 and @447462872590 left to vote
25/03/2022, 14:36 - Sam Lea: Very much a fenceman, it has to be said
25/03/2022, 14:36 - Sam Lea: Compelling arguments on both sides!
25/03/2022, 14:36 - James Kemp: And George if you‚Äôre remaining a fence man than the Julys have it?
25/03/2022, 14:37 - +44 7462 872590: Yep, I'm happy to be a July guy, as it gives us more time to book.
25/03/2022, 14:37 - James Kemp: Okay cool! So that means we should be looking between 4th - 14th July
25/03/2022, 14:37 - James Kemp: Obv not saying all that time, but that‚Äôs our range if we wanna search with her
25/03/2022, 14:53 - +44 7752 359588: What I would propose for max efficiency - if we assume the 4-14th as a range
25/03/2022, 14:54 - +44 7752 359588: Over the next few days, anyone who wants to, chucks in their suggestions on the spreadsheet (I'll also take out those that no longer work)
25/03/2022, 14:54 - +44 7752 359588: Out of country proposals accepted, but detail how we get there and a rough estimate of costs
25/03/2022, 14:55 - Reuben Yarwood: This all sounds grand
25/03/2022, 14:55 - +44 7752 359588: We set a deadline, and then everyone votes - we could do ranked, or just one per person
25/03/2022, 14:55 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm putting in some planning time tomorrow. Happy with July
25/03/2022, 14:55 - +44 7752 359588: And everyone also gets one veto
25/03/2022, 14:55 - +44 7752 359588: (George I'll take out Wales, so you don't have to waste yours)
25/03/2022, 14:55 - Reuben Yarwood: George you're veto-ing North Wales?
25/03/2022, 14:55 - +44 7752 359588: And then we go with that?
25/03/2022, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: Not to be bossy, but trying to be efficient
25/03/2022, 14:56 - Aaron Ayling: All sounds great
25/03/2022, 14:56 - Reuben Yarwood: No I'm loving this Liz
25/03/2022, 14:57 - +44 7752 359588: Final numbers would be useful, because if we're swinging closer to 8 people (so @447940330084 if Cesca says no), we could probs do a 4 bed
25/03/2022, 14:57 - James Kemp: BAN BOSSY
25/03/2022, 14:57 - +44 7752 359588: Which might open up some options
25/03/2022, 14:58 - James Kemp: When should we aim to have long list in by?
25/03/2022, 14:58 - James Kemp: End of the weekend?
25/03/2022, 14:59 - James Kemp: (Also there was a girl who lived two doors down from me when I was growing up who played the bagpipes. She was like 5 years older than me. AND SHE STILL LIVES AT HOME AND IS STILL PLAYING THE BAGPIPES AND SHE HAS GOTTEN NO BETTER IN FIFTEEN YEARS?)
25/03/2022, 14:59 - +44 7462 872590: I won't veto all of North Wales. Wouldn't be my preference, but if it is the best/most popular option then happy to go with it.
25/03/2022, 14:59 - James Kemp: (It is so painful)
25/03/2022, 15:00 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 15:01 - Reuben Yarwood: What the fuck. RIP your parents
25/03/2022, 15:01 - Sam Lea: Scotland the Brave at 0.001x speed?
25/03/2022, 15:01 - James Kemp: 35 years old, living at home, can‚Äôt learn bagpipes in 15 years of trying
25/03/2022, 15:01 - James Kemp: Give it UP
25/03/2022, 15:01 - Sam Lea: Like the Dunkirk Hans Zimmer score
25/03/2022, 15:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Okay to throw a spanner in the works immediately
25/03/2022, 15:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Ella is the best man for a friend and is organising his stag do for July 8th-9th
25/03/2022, 15:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Which I am invited to but could maybe miss. (hence I put it as a can make it work on the calendar)
25/03/2022, 15:03 - James Kemp: I mean, if you said available
25/03/2022, 15:03 - James Kemp: Not trying to be a diiick
25/03/2022, 15:03 - Reuben Yarwood: I can miss it if this is the best week go everyone
25/03/2022, 15:03 - Reuben Yarwood: *for
25/03/2022, 15:03 - Reuben Yarwood: But obviously Ella wouldn't make it
25/03/2022, 15:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Just liaising with her. I don't think she minds missing it.
25/03/2022, 15:05 - Reuben Yarwood: She could maybe come for a couple of days during the week
25/03/2022, 15:06 - James Kemp: Yeah someone else can sort I‚Äôm already exhausted aha
25/03/2022, 15:10 - Aaron Ayling: I would much rather July if possible, think a month is too short to organise?
25/03/2022, 15:41 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah preference for July, but reubs, if that's killer we'll rearrange! Maybe chat to Ella and come back to us on it?
25/03/2022, 16:01 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm happy missing the stag, it's Madeleine and Ella's friend so if more be going for moral support to E. But she doesn't mind me not attending.
25/03/2022, 16:01 - Reuben Yarwood: *I'd
25/03/2022, 16:04 - Edward Beesley: How many nights are we thinking of going for?
25/03/2022, 16:08 - +44 7752 359588: I'd say at least 5 nights? But depending on the booking, might make sense to book a week (people can come and go?) As some places have a week discount
25/03/2022, 16:08 - +44 7752 359588: Saw one that had a 50% week discount
25/03/2022, 16:10 - Aaron Ayling: I'd be there the whole time with my empty ass calendar
25/03/2022, 16:12 - Aaron Ayling: Well let's stick with July then if Reubs can still make it and Ella's cool to pop in when she can
25/03/2022, 16:15 - Reuben Yarwood: She'd be poppin either way
25/03/2022, 17:32 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 17:32 - James Kemp: Okay she got her talent together
25/03/2022, 17:32 - James Kemp: But I need her dead
25/03/2022, 17:32 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah that sounds okay (as a 17 second clip I can stop whenever I want)
25/03/2022, 17:41 - Sam Lea: Surely they do electric bagpipes with earphones these days
25/03/2022, 18:56 - +44 7752 359588: I mean the bagpipes sound kind of great
25/03/2022, 18:56 - +44 7752 359588: But I would also die listening to them all the time
25/03/2022, 18:56 - +44 7752 359588: Are your parents not fed up?? You can hear it so clearly!
25/03/2022, 19:06 - Aaron Ayling: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ICTnIiSoY0WEVSUF310m2iSgczaaJULITZW2U8iLmkQ/edit?usp=drivesdk

^ spreadsheet link for everyone again.
25/03/2022, 19:07 - Aaron Ayling: Let's say a deadline of **March 30th** (next wednesday) to have your suggestions and additional costs added to the spreadsheet. We'll vote after that
25/03/2022, 19:08 - Aaron Ayling: Look for dates between 4th - 14th July, may get a week discount on some places so bear that in mind.
25/03/2022, 19:10 - Aaron Ayling: Realise its short but if we dilly dally too much suggestions we put in will be booked before we decide etc etc.
25/03/2022, 19:10 - James Kemp: No, 100% endorse!!
25/03/2022, 19:10 - Aaron Ayling: @447940330084 can we have confirmation on if Cesca will come ASAP so we can firm up the numbers.
25/03/2022, 19:10 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll do some inputting at some point this weekend
25/03/2022, 19:11 - Aaron Ayling: I'd also appreciate it if someone who would be driving could have a cursory look at car rental costs
25/03/2022, 19:14 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
25/03/2022, 19:27 - Sam Lea: Obviously if we're staying in the UK we'd have mine, but yeah we'll need a second to allow all 8 of us to be mobile
25/03/2022, 19:28 - +44 7752 359588: Just hitch me up to the back in a shopping cart, eh
25/03/2022, 19:56 - Edward Beesley: Yes, will try and pin her down asap - not been in simultaneously these few days
25/03/2022, 19:59 - Aaron Ayling: Thanks all! Appreciate the hustle and effort. Will be worth it!
25/03/2022, 20:02 - Edward Beesley: I know the May vs July thing is already decided now but I was busy earlier and wasn't able to add my thoughts, so just for completeness my reasoning for preferring May was:
- Flights and accommodation both cheaper in May from what I've seen
- Our availabilities seemed less complicated in May - we're all very flexible then so would probably facilitate everyone being able to go for the full time, weekend-to-weekend
- May would be just as good (if not better) a time to go somewhere sunny than July

I guess July > May for a UK trip; May > July for a foreign trip. And it would certainly be easier to have _drugs_ for a UK trip, so the July verdict certainly has its advantages...
25/03/2022, 20:57 - Aaron Ayling: I guess feel free to search for foreign holidays during May dates, just caveat it as those days and we'll factor that in when we vote
25/03/2022, 20:57 - Aaron Ayling: I would prefer July though!
25/03/2022, 22:01 - +61 474 759 280: This has been a delight to follow, democracy in action etc
25/03/2022, 22:05 - +44 7752 359588: Not too late to get your tix
25/03/2022, 22:34 - +61 474 759 280: In that case, July
25/03/2022, 22:39 - +44 7752 359588: Watching the first ep of the American Song contest
25/03/2022, 22:40 - +44 7752 359588: Mostly unknowns, but then also fucking Michael Bolton and Jewel???
25/03/2022, 22:40 - Aaron Ayling: How is it?
25/03/2022, 22:41 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I literally just started it
25/03/2022, 22:41 - +44 7752 359588: So far trash
25/03/2022, 22:41 - +44 7752 359588: But I have a lot of time for Snoop Dogg and Kelly Clarkson as hosts
25/03/2022, 22:41 - James Kemp: Yeah like we‚Äôve already decided July what is this?
25/03/2022, 22:41 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
25/03/2022, 22:41 - James Kemp: Y‚Äôall bitches messy (still love ya)
25/03/2022, 22:53 - Edward Beesley: Just being a typical ReMayner

25/03/2022, 22:55 - James Kemp: This is gonna be so fun!! Eeeeeeeee
25/03/2022, 22:55 - +61 474 759 280: üíØ
25/03/2022, 23:10 - +44 7752 359588: Ok Oklahoma put in a KPop song which I like
25/03/2022, 23:22 - James Kemp: Link??
25/03/2022, 23:23 - +44 7752 359588: https://youtu.be/5mBQHmcLdvU
25/03/2022, 23:23 - +44 7752 359588: Predictably I also like Puerto Rico's garbage entry
25/03/2022, 23:23 - +44 7752 359588: But none of this is naff enough
25/03/2022, 23:23 - James Kemp: Oh shit is this US Eurovision??
25/03/2022, 23:23 - James Kemp: When is it?
25/03/2022, 23:23 - +44 7752 359588: Also guys - I feel like I'm seeing a lot of hot tubs, which I am down for
25/03/2022, 23:24 - +44 7752 359588: Yes! On now! It's being treated like a proper tv show, so one semi final every week
25/03/2022, 23:24 - James Kemp: Oh shit it‚Äôs happening now?
25/03/2022, 23:24 - James Kemp: Can we get together for the final?
25/03/2022, 23:28 - +44 7752 359588: Ahaha sure
25/03/2022, 23:28 - +44 7752 359588: I'm sure we can find it somewhere, tho maybe not live
25/03/2022, 23:28 - James Kemp: Yes we need to!!
25/03/2022, 23:28 - +44 7752 359588: It's very weird
25/03/2022, 23:28 - +44 7752 359588: And not nearly as good as Eurovision
25/03/2022, 23:29 - +44 7752 359588: Michael Bolton just said "New York has the best pizza in new York"????
25/03/2022, 23:29 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think it was a joke
25/03/2022, 23:29 - James Kemp: R/Technicallythetruth

26/03/2022, 12:36 - James Kemp: LOL
26/03/2022, 12:36 - James Kemp: Gonna flood the spreadsheet with Wales options just to trigger ya
26/03/2022, 12:36 - +44 7462 872590: I'm literally adding place to the spreadsheet now that aren't Wales
26/03/2022, 12:36 - James Kemp: Ahaha
26/03/2022, 12:37 - James Kemp: I wouldn‚Äôt do that to you bb üòò
26/03/2022, 12:40 - James Kemp: Also not sure if y‚Äôall‚Äôs drinks plans are gonna materialize today, but we‚Äôre gonna take a chill one here in the Heath- think parents are quite keen for some facetime so apparently it‚Äôs a beers in the garden vibe
26/03/2022, 12:40 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
26/03/2022, 12:40 - +44 7752 359588: ITS LITERALLY SNOWING HERE
26/03/2022, 12:40 - +44 7752 359588: I feel attacked
26/03/2022, 12:40 - James Kemp: NO
26/03/2022, 12:44 - Reuben Yarwood: The British Riviera!
26/03/2022, 12:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Jesus. Hard to imagine right now üòÖ
26/03/2022, 12:47 - +44 7752 359588: The weather is very rude here
26/03/2022, 14:27 - +44 7752 359588: Good looking Airbnb research folks
26/03/2022, 14:27 - +44 7752 359588: Lots of options
26/03/2022, 14:28 - +44 7752 359588: I like some of these descriptions too
27/03/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
27/03/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: (From some trash 00s MTV show)
27/03/2022, 11:21 - Aaron Ayling: Haha love this
27/03/2022, 11:22 - Aaron Ayling: Definitely misread Kyle's first bullet point from the thumbnail
27/03/2022, 13:29 - +44 7752 359588: Omg I love this
27/03/2022, 13:29 - +44 7752 359588: Brett's vest
27/03/2022, 13:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Brett would not do well during Covid
27/03/2022, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: @447462872590 was it you who added your uncle's place in North Wales?
27/03/2022, 13:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Just costing the Brittany option and it would probably work out more expensive overall if we were to get the ferry as it's well expensive.
27/03/2022, 13:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Unfortunately flying is so much cheaper. Or staying in the UK
27/03/2022, 13:48 - +44 7752 359588: Crazy that a ferry is more expensive than flying
27/03/2022, 13:48 - Reuben Yarwood: It's extortionate
27/03/2022, 13:51 - +44 7462 872590: Yes it was
27/03/2022, 13:52 - +44 7462 872590: Bit of a curve ball I know
27/03/2022, 13:53 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm always down for a freebee. I'm happy to pay more though if it means you don't have to go to Wales!
27/03/2022, 13:55 - +44 7752 359588: Same! I did get rid of all my Wales suggestions!
27/03/2022, 13:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Ed have you heard anything from Cesca?
27/03/2022, 13:56 - Reuben Yarwood: Please note that Ella is only coming for a weekend so we will have to factor that into the price
27/03/2022, 13:59 - Reuben Yarwood: It would be better to not factor in Ella for now, and she will hopefully make if for a few days and chip in
27/03/2022, 14:23 - Reuben Yarwood: Also - me and Ella are going to buy tickets to All Points East today.
27/03/2022, 14:23 - Reuben Yarwood: For this day: https://www.allpointseastfestival.com/the-national-tickets/
27/03/2022, 14:24 - Reuben Yarwood: If anyone wants in there is a 6 tickets for 5 offer
27/03/2022, 14:25 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm possibly also doing the Friday of this https://wideawakelondon.co.uk/
27/03/2022, 14:48 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm gonna do a stint of adding places this avo!
27/03/2022, 14:48 - James Kemp: Already at Shindig this weekend!
27/03/2022, 14:48 - James Kemp: Would be keen for APE tho
27/03/2022, 15:09 - +44 7752 359588: Obvs we'll be gone, so count us out of APE
27/03/2022, 15:30 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm not fussed about the National but lots of other good acts that day
27/03/2022, 18:26 - Reuben Yarwood: I can't believe there's a real village called "Westward Ho!"
27/03/2022, 18:32 - +44 7752 359588: Same! I was like, this is not a place
27/03/2022, 18:51 - Reuben Yarwood: I've just got the All Points East tickets by the way. Megan and Charlie are coming with me and Ella. So two 60 quid tickets available at the mo! Let me know if anyone fancies it. You could always join later, it's about  69 for a single ticket.
27/03/2022, 18:52 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll take one, mate!
27/03/2022, 18:52 - James Kemp: You want payment now? Happy to!
27/03/2022, 18:52 - Reuben Yarwood: I've just stuck it on my credit card, but if you're keen then that would be grand!
27/03/2022, 19:02 - Sam Lea: I'd be keen for this! Possibly APE as well but happy to wait to get a ticket closer to the time
27/03/2022, 19:02 - +44 7462 872590: I am also in for both
27/03/2022, 19:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Sick.
27/03/2022, 19:43 - James Kemp: okay i've added 10 to the sheet!
27/03/2022, 19:43 - James Kemp: tried to give a bit of variety
27/03/2022, 20:27 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh girl we have got CHOICES
27/03/2022, 20:27 - +44 7752 359588: We might need to reconsider how voting works
27/03/2022, 20:27 - +44 7752 359588: Do we have heats? Quarter and semi finals?
27/03/2022, 20:28 - James Kemp: How do we make it the most like Eurovision possible?
27/03/2022, 20:29 - +44 7752 359588: This is precisely what I was thinking
27/03/2022, 20:29 - +44 7752 359588: A televote and a jury vote
28/03/2022, 04:21 - +44 7752 359588: Guys I'm watching the Oscars for the first time in 1000 years and will Smith got up on stage and slapped Chris rock because he made a GI Jane joke about Jada who is losing her hair
28/03/2022, 04:22 - +44 7752 359588: And then he won best actor and gave a VERY uncomfortable speech about protecting female actresses and his family
28/03/2022, 04:22 - +44 7752 359588: It was long and awkward
28/03/2022, 04:23 - +44 7752 359588: Agh highly recommend watching it, it was wild
28/03/2022, 04:37 - Sam Lea: Taking this in indirectly via twitter
28/03/2022, 04:37 - Sam Lea: Crazy bit of business
28/03/2022, 04:37 - Sam Lea: Seemingly not staged?
28/03/2022, 04:45 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah at first I thought it was staged, but if you watch the uncensored version (thank you japanese tv) it was clearly not

28/03/2022, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: Also guys a reminder to get your holiday picks in by Wednesday. Then I will finalise the voting sheet. Won't necessarily be final, but will help us see where we stand and can then vote again. I have done a table that will take your top 3 choices and tot up the rankings of everyone.
28/03/2022, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: Also @447940330084 - apologies if I missed this, Cesca yes or no?
28/03/2022, 12:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Thanks for putting in a shift in the house hunt Jim!
28/03/2022, 12:22 - James Kemp: üëäüèª
28/03/2022, 12:22 - James Kemp: I thought there were some real gems in there!
28/03/2022, 12:23 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd imagine I‚Äôve gone too rural with some, but didn‚Äôt wanna rule it out prematurely as not sure on everyone‚Äôs vibe
28/03/2022, 12:36 - Reuben Yarwood: I added a couple of towny ones if we want to go that way
28/03/2022, 12:36 - Reuben Yarwood: A long weekend in Brighton could be fun if we don't fancy the wilderness week
28/03/2022, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: But I'm down for some rural walks
28/03/2022, 12:40 - Aaron Ayling: yeah my votes will be going for more rural places I think
28/03/2022, 12:41 - Sam Lea: Rural + a "thing" to a go and look at (little nearby village, the sea, a castle) would be good
28/03/2022, 12:42 - Reuben Yarwood: Yep, agreed!
28/03/2022, 12:43 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs basically what I was thinking! I think most of mine tick this box, with the exception of a couple more town-y and one which is super fucking off grid
28/03/2022, 12:43 - James Kemp: So much so I couldn‚Äôt even figure out how to reach it üòÖ
28/03/2022, 12:44 - James Kemp: But yeah I‚Äôm down for rural but something fun walkable
28/03/2022, 12:46 - Aaron Ayling: well the voting table is working if you want to put in some preliminary votes, I can easily update if we have any more suggestions added
28/03/2022, 12:46 - Aaron Ayling: maybe say Friday as voting deadline day
28/03/2022, 12:46 - James Kemp: Am happy to wait!
28/03/2022, 12:47 - James Kemp: Last 3 days on job so kinda stacked
28/03/2022, 12:47 - James Kemp: Thx for setting up voting tho - EXCITING
28/03/2022, 12:47 - James Kemp: Hope there‚Äôs drama
28/03/2022, 12:47 - James Kemp: üåö
28/03/2022, 12:54 - Reuben Yarwood: After all this hoo-ha about the slap, I'm just here for Timoth√©e Chalamets fuckboy outfit:

28/03/2022, 14:14 - +44 7752 359588: This was my vibe, partially also because I imagine we'll be loud AF sometimes (and smoking weed outside) so you probably don't want cranky neighbors
28/03/2022, 14:14 - +44 7752 359588: My other big thing is a dishwasher, which I think they pretty much all have
28/03/2022, 14:15 - Aaron Ayling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWa-6g-TbgI
28/03/2022, 14:15 - +44 7752 359588: Look with that many people ina house, do you really want to be hand washing plates???
28/03/2022, 14:17 - Aaron Ayling: oh i agree, just found it funny
28/03/2022, 14:25 - Aaron Ayling: ooh really like some of the ones you put in JIm
28/03/2022, 14:58 - James Kemp: ü•∞
28/03/2022, 15:15 - Edward Beesley: Yo - re: Cesca, she's keen to join in principle but because she works with kids she's bound by school-holiday term times, so she wouldn't be able to do a full week. However, she'd be up for joining for a weekend or so, but that's somewhat dependent on where as it'd only be for one/two nights (eg wouldn't work if we went to Croatia, say, but would if we went to, say, Suffolk). Best thing I think is if we assume she's a "no" for the purposes of deciding where we want to go/what cost per person will be; and then if she's able to join for some time and chip in pro rata for how long she's there, then it's a nice bonus.
28/03/2022, 15:16 - Edward Beesley: /if the place is able to house the extra person
28/03/2022, 15:17 - Edward Beesley: Also: do we want to go for our third victory this Wednesday, or shall we wait until everyone's available?
28/03/2022, 15:18 - Edward Beesley: I'll book it if we fancy it
28/03/2022, 15:20 - Edward Beesley: If we do, quiz team name this week should be "Keep my quiz team name out your fucking mouth"
28/03/2022, 15:22 - Reuben Yarwood: So good
28/03/2022, 15:30 - +44 7462 872590: Nice
28/03/2022, 15:47 - Aaron Ayling: Cool, well that means let's all plan for 7 people, everyone
28/03/2022, 15:48 - Aaron Ayling: Sam George and I were saying let's have a week off!
28/03/2022, 15:50 - Sam Lea: We could be brave and back ourselves to do it with just 5 of us, but obvs probability is less on our side than if we're a person down...
28/03/2022, 15:50 - Sam Lea: Just don't want to give our rivals the satisfaction!
28/03/2022, 15:50 - Sam Lea: *if
28/03/2022, 15:59 - Aaron Ayling: Oh yeah @447585334190 forgot to tell you the guys we beat when you were there came 2nd again last week haha
28/03/2022, 19:17 - James Kemp: Ha no way!
28/03/2022, 19:17 - James Kemp: They seemed like they had a good sense of humor?
28/03/2022, 19:18 - James Kemp: Also good to beat them honestly to prove you could??
28/03/2022, 23:49 - +44 7752 359588: Ooof just saw a car take a terrible u turn and smack right into a car
28/03/2022, 23:49 - +44 7752 359588: Which turned out to be an unmarked police car
28/03/2022, 23:49 - +44 7752 359588: Driver fled
28/03/2022, 23:49 - +44 7752 359588: I assume the original car was stolen?
28/03/2022, 23:49 - +61 474 759 280: Sheeeeit
28/03/2022, 23:50 - +44 7752 359588: But he wasn't being chased by the cops, just drove super recklessly straight into one
28/03/2022, 23:50 - +61 474 759 280: Is crime very visible in Chicago?
28/03/2022, 23:51 - +61 474 759 280: Or is it like Hackney where apparently very common but under the surface
28/03/2022, 23:51 - +44 7752 359588: Typically not where I live
28/03/2022, 23:51 - +44 7752 359588: Probably more like this, but with more muggings

29/03/2022, 13:59 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah it's got a nice big balcony
29/03/2022, 14:00 - +44 7462 872590: But yeah that's an option, it's ours if we want it.
29/03/2022, 14:01 - Aaron Ayling: can't overlook the "free" factor for sure, and I guess the fact we're 7 people now (and that if Cesca/Ella come they won't overlap) that probably helps too.
29/03/2022, 14:02 - Aaron Ayling: but obviously neighbours will see our drug orgies
29/03/2022, 14:04 - +44 7462 872590: Yep proximity to neighbours is probably the main downside
29/03/2022, 14:08 - Aaron Ayling: Whats the village name?
29/03/2022, 14:08 - +44 7462 872590: Criccieth
29/03/2022, 14:09 - Sam Lea: And are the neighbours likely to be in all month, or are they away at any stage...?
29/03/2022, 14:10 - +44 7462 872590: I don't know. I think it's a mix of holiday house that get rented out and people who live there full time. I would anticipate people being there.
29/03/2022, 14:12 - +44 7462 872590: It's also next to an ice cream shop
29/03/2022, 14:14 - Aaron Ayling: And while I think we'd want cars, it seems to be train-able (just have to get to Birmingham then sit on a train for 5 hours)
29/03/2022, 14:14 - Aaron Ayling: just for anyone coming later on
29/03/2022, 14:15 - Aaron Ayling: _food for thought_
29/03/2022, 14:15 - +44 7462 872590: And it is apparently one of Europe's most scenic railway journeys
29/03/2022, 14:15 - James Kemp: Well lube me up and call me Betty!
29/03/2022, 14:15 - James Kemp: She‚Äôs a stone cold stunner!
29/03/2022, 14:36 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah she's a beaut!
29/03/2022, 14:37 - Reuben Yarwood: I would be prepared to be near other houses if it means saving ¬£300
29/03/2022, 14:38 - Reuben Yarwood: But not had a chance to check all yours out yet Jimbo
29/03/2022, 14:53 - James Kemp: Vibe!
29/03/2022, 16:04 - Reuben Yarwood: BUT - would we be prepared to drag George kicking and screaming back to North Wales?
29/03/2022, 16:06 - Aaron Ayling: Also I guess we'd have to be a bit cleaner than we might otherwise be (and clean at the end)
29/03/2022, 16:07 - Aaron Ayling: Anyway, we can see how the votes fall!
29/03/2022, 16:20 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah seriously George, don't throw yourself on your sword for us
29/03/2022, 17:00 - +44 7462 872590: No worries at all. I'm happy to go with whatever works best for everyone. Just wanna be with you guys.
29/03/2022, 18:46 - Aaron Ayling: Right guys we went back to Martello Hall (where our wedding reception is gonna be) coz we wanna use the deposit for SOMETHING. literally every Friday and Saturday in May June and July is booked already.

They have Wednesday the 1st of June free (Thursday and Friday that week are Bank Holidays) , and that's basically it.

George realise you were planning drinks for the 2nd for your bday but wanted to check in and see if we could all do something on the 1st otherwise we'd basically have to lose the deposit or maybe do a Thursday
29/03/2022, 19:43 - +44 7462 872590: Yep I gonna do drinks on the 2nd. But very happy to have a shindig on the 1st as well. Last night of the 20s.
29/03/2022, 19:43 - Reuben Yarwood: 48 hr party?

29/03/2022, 19:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Hell
29/03/2022, 19:48 - Reuben Yarwood: We'll have to break in and make it an illegal rave because I think it's still shut
29/03/2022, 19:49 - +44 7752 359588: Even better
29/03/2022, 21:26 - James Kemp: I am freeeeeeeee
29/03/2022, 21:26 - James Kemp: And keen!
29/03/2022, 21:27 - +61 474 759 280: Probably a good thing i‚Äôm back home now because I think this would probably kill me
29/03/2022, 21:27 - James Kemp: Walked past it today, can confirm
29/03/2022, 21:34 - +44 7752 359588: It may well kill me haha
29/03/2022, 21:34 - +44 7752 359588: But what a way to go
29/03/2022, 21:34 - +44 7752 359588: I'm trying to get our photographer in for it too
29/03/2022, 21:35 - +44 7752 359588: So y'all best look glamourous
29/03/2022, 21:36 - +44 7752 359588: Do we spring for a lifesize cutout of @61474759280
30/03/2022, 10:20 - Aaron Ayling: Thanks for partying all the time with us
30/03/2022, 10:20 - Aaron Ayling: Also how tf is snow forecast tonight
30/03/2022, 10:21 - Aaron Ayling: Final call for your holiday picks as well everyone. Let's say a deadline of 6pm (shout if you need longer) and then we can start the voting
30/03/2022, 10:22 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm happy to leave mine there!
30/03/2022, 10:22 - James Kemp: Could add more but felt like they were starting to duplicate

30/03/2022, 16:48 - +44 7752 359588: Photographer confirmed in! Prepare for a well documented sesh lol
30/03/2022, 16:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds fun! What's the vibe? Boozing and music kind of thing?
30/03/2022, 16:54 - +44 7752 359588: Yep
30/03/2022, 16:54 - +44 7752 359588: I'm busting out that wedding playlist we made 2 years ago
30/03/2022, 17:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Can't wait!
30/03/2022, 17:05 - +44 7752 359588: Should also be a partially open bar at least
30/03/2022, 17:05 - +44 7752 359588: We have ¬£500 deposit, and we'll use a bit on pizza, but the rest is booze
30/03/2022, 17:06 - Reuben Yarwood: Hot damn.

30/03/2022, 21:10 - +44 7752 359588: Still have that choker
30/03/2022, 21:10 - James Kemp: Feel there‚Äôs a very clear line to adult Liz in them

Post voting I think we should consider one of the 4 options on the "round 2" tab, which are the only ones with more than one vote, listed sort of in order
03/04/2022, 12:13 - Aaron Ayling: Slight preference from me for either the 70s sesh pad (firepit) or George's place (easier planning/free)

03/04/2022, 13:29 - Reuben Yarwood: The Blackpool place looks hilarious. My only worry is that it's very much in the North West so might be a bit rainy? That's why I went for the old Army Barracks place, similar vibe but in Kent. Maybe nicer walking too? It is more expensive though.
03/04/2022, 13:30 - Reuben Yarwood: *Old Army Cinema
03/04/2022, 18:13 - +44 7462 872590: Looks great!

03/04/2022, 18:20 - +44 7752 359588: I'll admit to knowing very little about Blackpool and the area - is the weather still more likely to be shit in the summer?
03/04/2022, 18:20 - +44 7752 359588: The Kent one looks nice - I sort of just avoided any one where there were neighbors obviously nearby
03/04/2022, 18:20 - +44 7752 359588: But Aaron and I took a trip to Kent with my parents a few years ago and we stayed really close to there and it was nice!
03/04/2022, 18:21 - +44 7752 359588: Lots of nice day trips in the area too

04/04/2022, 07:30 - Aaron Ayling: (he also took ¬£100k from Russia, thats why the joke works)
04/04/2022, 10:33 - +44 7752 359588: Surely this isn't real?
04/04/2022, 10:33 - Reuben Yarwood: April fools?
04/04/2022, 10:34 - Aaron Ayling: I imagine the thing Johnny posted is satire, but there was an MP pictured with drugs who harassed women who was suspended
04/04/2022, 10:36 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 10:36 - Reuben Yarwood: That's the dandruff?

05/04/2022, 09:31 - Sam Lea: What's the weather s'posed to be like Sat / Sun?
05/04/2022, 09:32 - James Kemp: Sat looks sunny but not that hot??
05/04/2022, 09:32 - James Kemp: Sunday cloud
05/04/2022, 09:44 - +44 7752 359588: Weather is RUSE
05/04/2022, 09:45 - +44 7752 359588: Rude even haha
05/04/2022, 09:45 - +44 7752 359588: But also a ruse
05/04/2022, 09:46 - James Kemp: We‚Äôre still living in a bit of a cardboard kingdom here, but happy to have y‚Äôall preemptively over or go for a walk or for a pub or for all three or any combination thereof!
05/04/2022, 09:46 - James Kemp: OR FOR NONE A DA
05/04/2022, 09:47 - +44 7752 359588: I'd be down to see the hood!
05/04/2022, 09:51 - Reuben Yarwood: There's a Dulwich Hamlet game on Saturday
05/04/2022, 09:51 - Reuben Yarwood: A "Madeleine Yarwood Approved Day Out"
05/04/2022, 09:52 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd be down!
05/04/2022, 09:53 - Reuben Yarwood: It's a little Deep South for you Manor Housians
05/04/2022, 09:53 - Reuben Yarwood: But it was a good time last time
05/04/2022, 09:54 - +44 7752 359588: Ahaha is Madeline a football fan?
05/04/2022, 09:54 - Reuben Yarwood: Not at all no
05/04/2022, 09:54 - Reuben Yarwood: We didn't really watch the game tbh
05/04/2022, 09:55 - +44 7752 359588: I mean this persuades me more lol
05/04/2022, 09:58 - James Kemp: Yeah I‚Äôm only in coz it seemed v chill
05/04/2022, 09:58 - James Kemp: And not that football-y üòÖ
05/04/2022, 10:00 - James Kemp: Could always check that out, mooch around the town, scope out a pub then bring you back to ours to show you the gaff?
05/04/2022, 10:00 - James Kemp: As a loose itinerary for the day üê∑
05/04/2022, 10:01 - James Kemp: There‚Äôs a market at the literal end of our steeet on saturdays
05/04/2022, 10:03 - James Kemp: Anyway, don‚Äôt wanna dictate plans so others do chime in!
05/04/2022, 10:04 - James Kemp: And final of my 5000 messages - do we need to revive holiday selecting? Got lost in the move madness for me
05/04/2022, 10:05 - Reuben Yarwood: I'd chuck my vote in for George's uncles but don't mind the shag pad
05/04/2022, 10:05 - James Kemp: These were both in my top 3 so also down with either!
05/04/2022, 10:33 - +44 7752 359588: We're down for Dulwich!
05/04/2022, 10:34 - +44 7752 359588: Do we need to buy tix first?
05/04/2022, 10:34 - +44 7752 359588: Yes, I was gonna chase on this shortly! Don't know if we want to do a final vote or just come to a consensus
05/04/2022, 10:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Nah just show up. It was about ¬£12.50?
05/04/2022, 11:18 - Edward Beesley: My two cents on the holiday selecting:
05/04/2022, 11:18 - Edward Beesley: My vote would be for somewhere large enough for everyone to get a comfortable sleeping set up. I think for 7 (+?) people for seven nights of seshing, better to have at least a bed each and plenty of space
05/04/2022, 11:19 - Edward Beesley: The only one left like that is option 4. So by default I would vote for that... But in any case I think it ticks all the boxes: rural, great beaches nearby, nearby pubs etc, and also is relatively far south for SUN. Big garden too
05/04/2022, 11:20 - Edward Beesley: But if it makes sense to go for George's uncle's place for flexibility and price, that's not a bad option either
05/04/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: Could ya re-link to sheet, laddy??
05/04/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: I lost it
05/04/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: (The sheet)
05/04/2022, 11:20 - Edward Beesley: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ICTnIiSoY0WEVSUF310m2iSgczaaJULITZW2U8iLmkQ/edit#gid=0
05/04/2022, 11:21 - James Kemp: Tyyyy!!
05/04/2022, 11:21 - James Kemp: So which one‚Äôs option 4?
05/04/2022, 11:21 - James Kemp: A bit lost between tabs
05/04/2022, 11:21 - James Kemp: üëµüèª

05/04/2022, 11:30 - Reuben Yarwood: It's this South Wales one
05/04/2022, 11:33 - Aaron Ayling: I don't like this south Wales one due to the only shower being in an outhouse.

Also the owners are literally next door.
05/04/2022, 11:33 - James Kemp: My thought is if we‚Äôre doing Wales and we don‚Äôt have to pay, why would we?
05/04/2022, 11:34 - James Kemp: Happy to rotate beds to ensure it‚Äôs not the same person on a blow up every night
05/04/2022, 11:34 - James Kemp: Also owners next door is DEATH?!
05/04/2022, 11:35 - James Kemp: So Reubs mentioned happy Ruth George‚Äôs uncles, Ed it sounded like your second favourite? I‚Äôm happy with it also? Is that emerging as our front runner?
05/04/2022, 11:36 - James Kemp: *with
05/04/2022, 11:44 - Aaron Ayling: Happy with it too, probs my second/third choice but for ease of planning and price it's good, as long as George is cool being dragged back to mordor
05/04/2022, 11:45 - James Kemp: @447595390314 @447462872590 any thoughts on final 4? (No rush, just keen we‚Äôre all heard)
05/04/2022, 11:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Not averse to the James Bond villain pad in Blackpool
05/04/2022, 11:52 - Aaron Ayling: Same! My number 1 tbh
05/04/2022, 11:53 - James Kemp: Is that on the final 4 tab?
05/04/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: I am Strugglina with this sheet
05/04/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: Ohhh yes sorry I see it
05/04/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: I mean, that was also my number 1
05/04/2022, 11:56 - +44 7462 872590: My picks in order:
1. Sinji, Croatia üòé
2. Blackpool
3. Uncle's place
4. South Wales
05/04/2022, 11:57 - James Kemp: Shall we all just rank final 4 and then pick the top spot?
05/04/2022, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: I will say my back is really fucked atm but am willing to pay more to guarantee a bed (if this was at George's place get a load of shopping in/more for the hire car.)
05/04/2022, 11:58 - Aaron Ayling: Sure
05/04/2022, 11:58 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll go‚Ä¶
1. Black pool
2. George‚Äôs uncle 
3. Sinj 
4. South Wales
05/04/2022, 11:59 - James Kemp: Thinking is, if we‚Äôre going Wales, might as well get it free and fuck having the neighbours next door
05/04/2022, 11:59 - James Kemp: *owners
05/04/2022, 12:02 - Aaron Ayling: Ahhh sorry guys I fucked up the final 4 and missed one out. As George was the only one to vote for Croatia that shouldn't have made it (sorry).

Anyway added the one I missed, its at the bottom.
05/04/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: Lmaooooo
05/04/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: This is the drama I dreamed of
05/04/2022, 12:03 - Aaron Ayling: A lot going on this week, sorry
05/04/2022, 12:03 - James Kemp: Oh girl no sweat
05/04/2022, 12:03 - James Kemp: You‚Äôve been Atlas for this whole project
05/04/2022, 12:03 - James Kemp: Should we vote in Sheet then to save chat madness?
05/04/2022, 12:03 - Aaron Ayling: My ranks :

1. Blackpool
2. George's Uncle
3. Shropshire (wrens nest)
4. South Wales
5 Croatia
05/04/2022, 12:03 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah sure
05/04/2022, 12:04 - Aaron Ayling: ^those are my votes anywho, can't really be fucked trying to organise an abroad trip tbh
05/04/2022, 12:05 - +44 7752 359588: My ranking is the same as aarons because we are now one body
05/04/2022, 12:05 - James Kemp: I will translate message voting here into the sheet now
05/04/2022, 12:05 - Aaron Ayling: Thx x
05/04/2022, 12:06 - Reuben Yarwood: 1. George's uncles.
2. bpool
3. South Wales
Etc
05/04/2022, 12:08 - James Kemp: Okay so based on that technical glitch, took Croatia off list (üòÖ)
05/04/2022, 12:09 - James Kemp: Currently Blackpool has 4 first place votes
05/04/2022, 12:09 - James Kemp: Presuming it isn‚Äôt superseded in George‚Äôs ranking by Shropshire
05/04/2022, 12:09 - Reuben Yarwood: The Blackpool place is approx an hour and a half from the Lake District
05/04/2022, 12:09 - James Kemp: And George‚Äôs uncles has 4 second place votes
05/04/2022, 12:10 - Reuben Yarwood: So my only worry is that the only walking we would do is to a grim Northern pub
05/04/2022, 12:10 - Reuben Yarwood: But I would suggest anyone who fancies it could do a day in the Lakes then I'm 10/10 happy with that
05/04/2022, 12:10 - Aaron Ayling: Would daytrip down to the LD!
05/04/2022, 12:11 - +44 7462 872590: Yep, Blackpool would be my new number 1, then Uncles place
05/04/2022, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: Always down
05/04/2022, 12:12 - James Kemp: Looking quite decisively Blackpool then?
05/04/2022, 12:12 - +61 474 759 280: I did not have this on my bingo card
05/04/2022, 12:13 - James Kemp: A moment‚Äôs shade for Shropshire: love the outside but the inside makes me wanna die
05/04/2022, 12:13 - +44 7752 359588: I fully respect this opinion hahaha
05/04/2022, 12:13 - Aaron Ayling: Haha same!
05/04/2022, 12:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Ella has suggested a night out in Blackpool
05/04/2022, 12:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Oggling the proles?
05/04/2022, 12:14 - James Kemp: Or, you know, just having fun?
05/04/2022, 12:14 - James Kemp: üåö
05/04/2022, 12:15 - Sam Lea: Yeah, having been to Blackpool before, it is decidedly grim üòÖ
05/04/2022, 12:15 - James Kemp: Safety in numbers?!
05/04/2022, 12:15 - James Kemp: DANGER SPOONS
05/04/2022, 12:15 - +61 474 759 280: I leave and suddenly the whole crew is up for the football and going to Lancashire
05/04/2022, 12:15 - +61 474 759 280: Typical
05/04/2022, 12:15 - Aaron Ayling: But lots of pretty coastline around we can drive to?
05/04/2022, 12:15 - James Kemp: üí• ü•Ñ s
05/04/2022, 12:16 - +61 474 759 280: ‚ÄúSuddenly‚Äù 2 years on, but still
05/04/2022, 12:17 - James Kemp: @447595390314 haven‚Äôt canvassed your opinion yet
05/04/2022, 12:17 - James Kemp: Would you be happy with Blackpool?
05/04/2022, 12:17 - James Kemp: And @447940330084 it didn‚Äôt feature on your initial feedback?
05/04/2022, 12:17 - James Kemp: Just making sure we‚Äôre all down before getting carried away
05/04/2022, 12:19 - Aaron Ayling: If everyone's second is George's Uncle's that's also a decent (very lovely!) compromise
05/04/2022, 12:19 - Aaron Ayling: As opposed to some people getting their 3rd/4th choice etc etc
05/04/2022, 12:19 - Aaron Ayling: Happy either way
05/04/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: Yep agree but if we‚Äôve got four first places, feel like we should at least start there?
05/04/2022, 12:20 - Aaron Ayling: Yep and yep
05/04/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: And so far seems like we‚Äôre all happy, just wanna make sure Sam and Ed are?
05/04/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: But then yes, happy to go to other options if not!
05/04/2022, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: Look guys maybe we should just all camp in brockwell park?
05/04/2022, 12:24 - Sam Lea: Instinctively, Blackpool itself as a destination feels like a hard no from me, though I haven't got there on the spreadsheet yet, so if accommodation is lush that might swing it... Combing through them now.
05/04/2022, 12:25 - James Kemp: Respect!
05/04/2022, 12:25 - James Kemp: No rush!
05/04/2022, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: Look at the round 2 tab btw
05/04/2022, 12:26 - James Kemp: Take yo time, weigh it all up - totally happy to flex to another option as Aaron says
05/04/2022, 12:26 - Sam Lea: Gotcha
05/04/2022, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: (it's at the top)
05/04/2022, 12:27 - Sam Lea: Also, assuming people are going with Blackpool in the knowledge that sunshine absolutely cannot be banked on in the North West
05/04/2022, 12:27 - Sam Lea: (I'm a pale boi for a reason)
05/04/2022, 12:27 - Sam Lea: Even in high summer
05/04/2022, 12:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah that was my worry
05/04/2022, 12:29 - James Kemp: Legit
05/04/2022, 12:33 - +44 7462 872590: Last year the lowest temperature in Croatia in July was 22 degrees...
05/04/2022, 12:34 - James Kemp: Ahaha
05/04/2022, 18:32 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>
05/04/2022, 18:33 - Sam Lea: Pre or post?! Good luck either way! üìØü¶Öüá∫üá∏üèà
05/04/2022, 18:37 - +44 7752 359588: Post! Still some stuff to upload, but it is done!

06/04/2022, 11:51 - +44 7752 359588: Spending the day being the biggest fucking blob
06/04/2022, 11:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Congrats on getting through this Aaron. Huge step out of the way!
06/04/2022, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: We had some celebratory pints yesterday so now I am a husk
06/04/2022, 12:04 - +61 474 759 280: Forgot you left your job
06/04/2022, 12:04 - +61 474 759 280: How have you been filling the days?
06/04/2022, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: It's mostly been jam packed with my mom visiting and being back home
06/04/2022, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: But right now I am binge watching garbage tv and writing bad fanfiction
06/04/2022, 12:05 - +61 474 759 280: Oh
06/04/2022, 12:05 - +44 7752 359588: Living the damn dream
06/04/2022, 12:05 - +61 474 759 280: ü§ô
06/04/2022, 12:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Lady Leshurr
06/04/2022, 12:25 - Sam Lea: Was enjoying a vid of Lady Leshurr the other day where she just reviews smoked salmon from different supermarkets
06/04/2022, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: haha this ties in with her appearance on Taskmaster where she told Alex that to complete a task she would need a lot of smoked salmon, then just sat there eating salmon instead of doing the task.
06/04/2022, 12:29 - +44 7752 359588: Ahahaha this was such a great moment too
06/04/2022, 14:43 - +44 7462 872590: Are we doing the pub quiz tonight?
06/04/2022, 14:59 - Reuben Yarwood: I've got the Pub Quiz Champions league down in my calendar as tomorrow night
06/04/2022, 15:27 - Sam Lea: Is that so?
06/04/2022, 15:28 - Sam Lea: In which case - do we quiz tonight to get warmer up... Or save ourselves to be fresh for to tomorrow?
06/04/2022, 15:28 - Sam Lea: *warmed
06/04/2022, 15:33 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm free tomorrow but not tonight!
06/04/2022, 18:09 - Edward Beesley: Yo - I'm away but yes the champions league quiz is tomorrow night. It's happening by Zoom, I've asked the quizman about it and he wants to know numbers. So, how many of you are in for it?
07/04/2022, 12:08 - James Kemp: Sorry for non response, Edward
07/04/2022, 12:08 - James Kemp: Probably gonna skip now!
07/04/2022, 12:09 - James Kemp: Need a night off after a hectic week!
07/04/2022, 12:11 - Sam Lea: I'm guessing we can do the next champions league fixture if we don't do it this week?
07/04/2022, 12:11 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah I don't think I'm really down for a zoom quiz tbh
07/04/2022, 12:11 - Aaron Ayling: Or we can just easily qualify again üòé

08/04/2022, 12:17 - +44 7752 359588: (also literally the only day we could book martello Hall where people wouldn't have work the next day)
08/04/2022, 12:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Hot damn. They are going to be some messy photos
08/04/2022, 12:19 - Reuben Yarwood: Untag
08/04/2022, 14:14 - Aaron Ayling: What's the plan tomoz BTW. Where /when we meeting, do we need tix?

08/04/2022, 16:32 - +44 7462 872590: I'd already made plans, which I was just reminded about so can't make Sat unfortunately. Can do something on Sunday... For the big game.
08/04/2022, 16:32 - Reuben Yarwood: 22 minutes on City Mapper
08/04/2022, 16:32 - James Kemp: Lovely!
08/04/2022, 16:33 - James Kemp: I am planning on not leaving my house on Sunday üíÄ
08/04/2022, 16:34 - Reuben Yarwood: By the way we might get some of Ella's pals on Saturday
08/04/2022, 16:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Meg again, maybe Charlie, Harry

09/04/2022, 11:51 - James Kemp: So whenever post 1?
09/04/2022, 11:51 - Reuben Yarwood: I'd you want anything beyond that go for it! Maybe some olives?
09/04/2022, 11:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Let's say 1.30
09/04/2022, 11:51 - James Kemp: üëåüèª
09/04/2022, 12:15 - +44 7752 359588: There like a tesco or corner shop near yours?
09/04/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: There was a lil corner shop opposite?
09/04/2022, 12:20 - James Kemp: I was planning on using it so ü§ûüèª I haven‚Äôt misremembered
09/04/2022, 12:24 - +44 7752 359588: Thaaanks
09/04/2022, 12:24 - Reuben Yarwood: There's a Londis opposite, or a Tesco near Herne Hill station at the bottom of the hill
09/04/2022, 13:31 - James Kemp: 15 mins away!
09/04/2022, 13:32 - James Kemp: Some roads google said exist did not exist
10/04/2022, 12:24 - James Kemp: Thank you all for a lovely Saturday, my dudes ü•∞
10/04/2022, 13:21 - Reuben Yarwood: Yes likewise! Great hang
10/04/2022, 13:23 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah it was great
10/04/2022, 13:23 - +44 7752 359588: I have now seen a football game!
10/04/2022, 14:37 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah great time - how was highlander?
10/04/2022, 14:40 - Sam Lea: Pleasantly bizarre
10/04/2022, 14:52 - +44 7752 359588: Man I really feel like I should go back and watch that now
10/04/2022, 15:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Surprisingly Tommy Wiseau vibe
10/04/2022, 15:19 - James Kemp: I honestly was so confused throughout
10/04/2022, 15:19 - James Kemp: But also enjoyed so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10/04/2022, 15:20 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
10/04/2022, 15:21 - Reuben Yarwood: ^Our one was a typist, but Mary Chapman sounds fun.

10/04/2022, 16:31 - +44 7752 359588: This is fun!
11/04/2022, 12:47 - Sam Lea: "Massage - Home Visits"üîéü§î
11/04/2022, 12:52 - Sam Lea: BTW what's the latest on any Vicky Park / London festivals?
11/04/2022, 12:52 - Sam Lea: Jim Reubs Ella you're doing one of APE dates, aye?
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Reuben Yarwood: We got the free Mighty Hoopla tix, as locals
11/04/2022, 12:55 - Reuben Yarwood: We're doing the National APE, for which there is one ¬£60 ticket available (as I got the 6 tickets for 5). Ella, Charlie, Meg and Jim are taking the others
11/04/2022, 13:00 - Reuben Yarwood: Dates:
Mighty Hoopla - 3rd June
Lambeth Country Show - 16th July
APE - 26th August
11/04/2022, 13:01 - Aaron Ayling: APE is after we leave unfortunately, and mighty hoopla being thr day after George's 30th (which is the day after our semi weddingy/leaving do) might kill me, but am open to any others people fancy!
11/04/2022, 13:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah it's going to be a big weekend!
11/04/2022, 13:05 - James Kemp: Our goal should be to look even more washed up than Steps by the end of it??
11/04/2022, 13:12 - +44 7752 359588: I think I can achieve this
11/04/2022, 13:22 - +44 7462 872590: I could definitely do a Mighty Hoopla on the 3rd üëÄ. My brother's over from Aus so I'll see if he's interested. Not sure what the plans are.
11/04/2022, 13:25 - +44 7462 872590: Have you guys already sorted your tickets for this for Friday 26th August?
13/04/2022, 16:05 - +44 7752 359588: ALRIGHT GUYS
13/04/2022, 16:05 - +44 7752 359588: I'm back again to ask: holiday choices???
13/04/2022, 16:06 - +44 7752 359588: I think when we last left it, we were sort of between George's Uncle's place and Blackpool - what do we say to a final vote??
13/04/2022, 16:21 - James Kemp: Ooh yes thanks for resurrecting
13/04/2022, 16:22 - James Kemp: It‚Äôd be good to have a final decision firmed up aye
13/04/2022, 16:22 - James Kemp: So just to get things rolling‚Ä¶ I will vote Blackpool, but happy if it‚Äôs George‚Äôs Uncle‚Äôs
13/04/2022, 16:23 - James Kemp: If everyone could similarly indicate one preference, that‚Äôd be good?
13/04/2022, 16:23 - +44 7462 872590: Same, I'll vote Blackpool, but happy with Uncle's place
13/04/2022, 16:24 - Reuben Yarwood: I'd go Uncle's just because I'm a stingy cunt. But happy with Blackpool.
13/04/2022, 16:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Also something about the word Blackpool gives me the fear. But I realise we'll be nearby not in the town
13/04/2022, 16:25 - James Kemp: Racist
13/04/2022, 16:30 - +44 7752 359588: My heart lies in blackpool
13/04/2022, 16:30 - +44 7752 359588: Do want to point out that it's the town of Stalmine, if that helps
13/04/2022, 16:32 - +44 7752 359588: And there's walks around - could probably get to the Wyre River, plus the Lancashire Coastal Path
13/04/2022, 16:33 - Sam Lea: George, what was the latest on acceptability of 'a bit of noise into the wee hours' (one at least one night)
13/04/2022, 16:37 - Aaron Ayling: I have a slight preference for the Blackpool (Stalmine) one as I think that'll be a great spacious place for us to all hang out, as well as having good walks nearby (forest that's an Arean of Outstanding Natural Beauty). If anyone really strongly wanted to veto this choice i'd be okay with the Guncle's place.
13/04/2022, 16:37 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah I mean I'm fine with George's Uncle's place too obvs
13/04/2022, 16:38 - +44 7752 359588: (Also, I believe guncle is slang for gay uncle)
13/04/2022, 16:38 - +44 7752 359588: Aaron has just informed me that was the joke
13/04/2022, 16:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Let's do it!
13/04/2022, 16:46 - Sam Lea: @447462872590
13/04/2022, 16:50 - +44 7462 872590: I'll ask about this
13/04/2022, 17:01 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 17:01 - Sam Lea: Having a proper go through of all the options, about half way there
13/04/2022, 17:01 - Sam Lea: Something urgents come up for work that needs to be done by the end of the day
13/04/2022, 17:01 - Aaron Ayling: mate you've missed the boat on all those sorry
13/04/2022, 17:02 - Sam Lea: Ah, okay
13/04/2022, 17:02 - Aaron Ayling: you get a choice between the blackpool one or George's Uncle
13/04/2022, 17:02 - Aaron Ayling: https://www.thebigdomain.com/cottages/damson-lodge?period=9&year=2022&sd=04072022
13/04/2022, 17:02 - Sam Lea: I've seen both of those
13/04/2022, 17:03 - Sam Lea: If that's the toss-up, pending noise not being a problem, I'd probably go with George's uncle's place? Let's see what the response is?
13/04/2022, 17:04 - Sam Lea: why's that, sorry - bit out of the loop
13/04/2022, 17:05 - Aaron Ayling: ^ that's why (posted on 31st of March)
13/04/2022, 17:06 - Sam Lea: üòÖ soz, completely missed that
13/04/2022, 17:06 - Sam Lea: Yeah fine, as I say my pick of those two frontrunners is Wales
13/04/2022, 17:07 - Aaron Ayling: no worries, just trying to organise etc etc
13/04/2022, 17:21 - James Kemp: So it‚Äôs currently 4-2 to Blackpool?
13/04/2022, 17:22 - James Kemp: Is anyone a hard no to either of the final two choices?
13/04/2022, 17:23 - James Kemp: Because, if not, and unless my maths is off, we‚Äôre saying Blackpool?
13/04/2022, 17:24 - Aaron Ayling: Just need @447940330084 to weigh in, but yeah you're right Jim
13/04/2022, 17:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Pleasure Beach here we come baby
13/04/2022, 19:03 - +44 7462 872590: Is anyone about in London over Easter?
13/04/2022, 19:04 - Aaron Ayling: Yep!
13/04/2022, 19:05 - +44 7462 872590: Any plans? Easter's kinda snuck up on me?
13/04/2022, 19:05 - James Kemp: We‚Äôre around Fri-Sun yes!
13/04/2022, 19:06 - James Kemp: No plans those days üòé
13/04/2022, 19:06 - Aaron Ayling: No!
13/04/2022, 19:07 - +44 7462 872590: üòéüòè
13/04/2022, 19:07 - James Kemp: Felt like I pulled everyone our way last weekend so someone else feel free to drive this time!
13/04/2022, 19:21 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm offski, but have fun lads
13/04/2022, 23:37 - +61 474 759 280: Election is on 21 May. My candidate has odds of 4.5:1 at the bookies. Instead of scaring me off that led me to bet $150 for her to win her seat
13/04/2022, 23:37 - +61 474 759 280: So I‚Äôm all in door knocking and calling until the day
13/04/2022, 23:38 - Aaron Ayling: Ooh good luck!
13/04/2022, 23:38 - +61 474 759 280: I might be drinking the cool aid but I feel like the odds are harsh on her so I‚Äôm taking a punt
13/04/2022, 23:38 - Aaron Ayling: You'd get like 700 dollars if she wins eh?
13/04/2022, 23:38 - +61 474 759 280: Yep!
13/04/2022, 23:40 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
13/04/2022, 23:40 - Sam Lea: Ditch the policies, just say that you've done this and can they help a mate out
14/04/2022, 00:32 - James Kemp: Love this energy
14/04/2022, 09:20 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe that's the way in - tell everyone else that they can still bet on her and if everyone votes for her, you all get paid
14/04/2022, 09:27 - Aaron Ayling: This is how bitcoin started
14/04/2022, 09:45 - +44 7462 872590: Response to this: "I think you should be ok. You have the ice cream place to the right but I think they might live above the shop and an old lady to the left. I think if you did some evening music at a reasonable level you should fine. I don‚Äôt think either have ever complained."
14/04/2022, 15:53 - James Kemp: So given the vote, and the apparent lack of veto, are we saying Blackpool is the winner?
14/04/2022, 15:53 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs that time at the altar
14/04/2022, 15:53 - James Kemp: Speak now or forever kiss my twink ass
14/04/2022, 15:55 - +44 7752 359588: Can I do both üòò
14/04/2022, 15:58 - James Kemp: üçë
14/04/2022, 16:04 - Edward Beesley: Sorry lads I'm meaning to reply to this but have just been descending a mountain. Will reply in the next 30
14/04/2022, 16:05 - James Kemp: All good, mate
14/04/2022, 16:05 - James Kemp: Think it‚Äôs now just at the point where we need to make a call
14/04/2022, 16:05 - James Kemp: Personally can handle either as I said, but we just need to confirm!
14/04/2022, 16:08 - +61 474 759 280: I would like to see the place in Blackpool
14/04/2022, 16:08 - +61 474 759 280: Pls
14/04/2022, 16:09 - James Kemp: https://www.thebigdomain.com/cottages/damson-lodge?period=9&year=2022&sd=04072022
14/04/2022, 16:10 - James Kemp: Unless I‚Äôm reading it wrong
14/04/2022, 16:10 - James Kemp: The inevitable might‚Äôve happened and it‚Äôs no longer available when we want it?
14/04/2022, 16:10 - James Kemp: Have I read that wrong?
14/04/2022, 16:10 - +61 474 759 280: Ooh la la
14/04/2022, 16:11 - Sam Lea: 4th to the 11th it looks booked...
14/04/2022, 16:11 - James Kemp: Ah no wait it‚Äôs there, but we can only have 5 nights?
14/04/2022, 16:11 - Edward Beesley: I think six nights, Friday to Thursday looks to be available?
14/04/2022, 16:12 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
14/04/2022, 16:12 - Edward Beesley: 8th to 14th is avail
14/04/2022, 16:12 - James Kemp: So basically stragglers hurry the fuck up and either confirm or veto plz üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
14/04/2022, 16:12 - James Kemp: Okay cool!
14/04/2022, 16:13 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
14/04/2022, 16:13 - Sam Lea: wot
14/04/2022, 16:14 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
14/04/2022, 16:14 - James Kemp: We can move to no. of nights we want as the next question once we‚Äôve confirmed if Blackpool actually is the one
14/04/2022, 16:15 - Reuben Yarwood: Let's book this Fuck
14/04/2022, 16:15 - James Kemp: I‚ÄôM TRYING
14/04/2022, 16:15 - James Kemp: Just need to elicit confirmation
14/04/2022, 16:17 - +44 7462 872590: Lets book!
14/04/2022, 16:18 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
14/04/2022, 16:18 - James Kemp: Waiting for Ed to finish typing the Bible
14/04/2022, 16:18 - James Kemp: ü§≠
14/04/2022, 16:18 - +61 474 759 280: ü¶òüéÖ
14/04/2022, 16:19 - Edward Beesley: Right, well I guess I don't feel so strongly as to veto Blackpool, but I do think George's uncle's place seems like a far nicer spot. It's near Snowdonia, and also has a sea view. And it's free. And Blackpool is reputedly the pits. I'm still happy enough to go with the Blackpool though, I'm just worried about the sleeping arrangements. I'd like to at least have a bed to myself and it seems like a bit of sharing would be required
14/04/2022, 16:20 - Sam Lea: Think Blackpool is the better option sleeping arrangements-wise, is it not?
14/04/2022, 16:21 - James Kemp: ‚Äú4 bedrooms - 1 king-size, 2 double and 1 twin‚Äù
14/04/2022, 16:21 - James Kemp: So room for 7 to sleep
14/04/2022, 16:21 - James Kemp: Which is what we are
14/04/2022, 16:21 - James Kemp: You‚Äôll have to share a double or take the twin to yourself
14/04/2022, 16:22 - Edward Beesley: Also re: the dates, im in Macclesfield from 14th/15th July so not sure I'd be able to drive back down to London on the return if I'm one of the designated drivers
14/04/2022, 16:22 - James Kemp: Yeah I got a meeting now
14/04/2022, 16:22 - Edward Beesley: But that could be fine if Sam and Reuben are both driveable
14/04/2022, 16:22 - James Kemp: Somebody else pick up and confirm plz
14/04/2022, 16:25 - +44 7752 359588: I mean if you want beds, I think it's Blackpool - George's uncle's place is 3 double/queens, no?
14/04/2022, 16:26 - +44 7752 359588: So everyone would have to double plus one on an air mattress or couch, not taking into account if Ella or Cesca come for a portion
14/04/2022, 16:27 - +44 7752 359588: So while I agree it's beautiful and a great location (and you can't argue with that price), it's ultimately probably too small to be workable
14/04/2022, 16:27 - +44 7462 872590: The sleep situation at George's Uncles place: 3 bedrooms. Main bedroom super king bed (with en suite). Front bedroom king size bed and rear bedroom two single beds. I can put a mattress down on the floor of the snug .. which makes 7 in total.
14/04/2022, 16:29 - +44 7462 872590: I also have a blow up single mattress I can bring, but would have to be in the lounge
14/04/2022, 16:29 - +44 7752 359588: Is the snug it's own room? No idea what a snug is hahaha
14/04/2022, 16:29 - +44 7752 359588: But love that as a name for a room
14/04/2022, 16:30 - +44 7462 872590: Yep, the snug is essentially a small lounge, it's own room
14/04/2022, 16:30 - +44 7462 872590: The bigger lounge that the blow up mattress would go in is open plan with the kitchen
14/04/2022, 16:30 - +44 7752 359588: Thank you for being our real estate agent George
14/04/2022, 16:31 - +44 7462 872590: Hey for you guys I'll only take 20% commission
14/04/2022, 16:31 - +44 7462 872590: üòé
14/04/2022, 16:32 - +44 7752 359588: So to sum up, I think we have 3 for Wales, 4 for Blackpool - with no vetoes, but more general Blackpool objections, ignoring poor George having to take a holiday at a family home
14/04/2022, 16:33 - +44 7752 359588: The pertinent questions probably are:
Who is comfortable sharing beds?
Are we expecting any plus ones at any point?
And Sam and Reuben are you good to drive?
14/04/2022, 16:34 - +44 7752 359588: Obviously Aaron and I will share, and Aaron is gonna need a real mattress (and likely not on the floor), because his back is very fucked right now
14/04/2022, 16:34 - +44 7752 359588: I'd love for this to be fully and firmly decided today, so if folks (and especially @447940330084 and @447725504296) can weigh in on the likliness of plus ones, that will help
14/04/2022, 16:35 - Reuben Yarwood: I could drive yep, hopefully I could borrow a car for the week from my Mum otherwise we could rent a second car
14/04/2022, 16:36 - +44 7752 359588: And obviously this doesn't need to be a firm commitment, but a general sense would help
14/04/2022, 16:38 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm happy sleeping anywhere, but Ella would want a bed. She could join 11th-14th. If you need a hard yes/no I will have to say no at this point.
14/04/2022, 16:38 - Reuben Yarwood: But she is planning to get the train to Blackpool after the weekend
14/04/2022, 16:39 - Reuben Yarwood: If we borrowed my mum's car we would maybe have to do a return train to Macc and drive from Macc to the house and back. That's an extra 90 quid or more like 50 if we book early
14/04/2022, 16:41 - Edward Beesley: Potentially I would be able to borrow a car for the Northernwards part of the journey, but would then stop off in it at Macclesfield on the return leg on the Thursday
14/04/2022, 16:42 - +44 7462 872590: I happy to sleep wherever with whomever üòò
14/04/2022, 16:42 - +44 7462 872590: I even sound like an uncle now
14/04/2022, 17:20 - James Kemp: Ditto
14/04/2022, 17:20 - James Kemp: Out of meeting now!
14/04/2022, 17:20 - James Kemp: Agree with let‚Äôs get this sorted today energy!
14/04/2022, 20:02 - Aaron Ayling: Okay final call:
Blackpool wins the outright vote
But I feel the Blackpool voters have less objections with Wales than vice versa.
Last chance to veto Blackpool @447940330084 @447595390314 @447725504296 otherwise we'll book Blackpool at ¬£300pp.
14/04/2022, 20:09 - Sam Lea: And in terms of
14/04/2022, 20:09 - Sam Lea: things to do
14/04/2022, 20:10 - Sam Lea: is this
14/04/2022, 20:10 - Sam Lea: (a convo that's already been had)
14/04/2022, 20:10 - Sam Lea: Just to itemise options of "stuff to do"
14/04/2022, 20:10 - Sam Lea: In the local area
14/04/2022, 20:10 - Sam Lea: You guys said you'd seen there are some nice walks?
14/04/2022, 20:11 - Aaron Ayling: We're 90 mins from the lakes, 20 mins from an AONB forest etc
14/04/2022, 20:11 - Aaron Ayling: Im largely thinking hangage around the pad for a couple of days too
14/04/2022, 20:12 - Aaron Ayling: Also if (when) we do go for Blackpool this does anyone have a credit card we can put this on? This is the type of thing that's better protected on a credit card, I don't have one and Liz's is in dollars (and we wanna spend down our pounds.)

Can obviously give whoever books our share immediately (tonight)
14/04/2022, 20:12 - Sam Lea: Day trip to the lakes would be a shout!
14/04/2022, 20:21 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah can't speak for walks straight out the door for the Blackpool one, but you're near enough the Lancashire coastal path and the wyre estuary
14/04/2022, 20:21 - +44 7752 359588: Know less about Wales, assume walking options are also good
14/04/2022, 20:22 - +44 7752 359588: (I think there are very few places in the UK where you can't get a halfway decent tramp on)
14/04/2022, 20:26 - Aaron Ayling: Looking forward to this either way!
14/04/2022, 20:30 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm very up for one or even two of these
14/04/2022, 20:30 - Reuben Yarwood: And driving us there if I'm driving
14/04/2022, 20:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Is it going to be ¬£2100? I think that's actually over my credit limit, will double check
14/04/2022, 20:31 - Reuben Yarwood: Likewise will pay anyone who can book it back tonight
14/04/2022, 20:45 - Sam Lea: an idea George and I just floated was the possibility of one couple getting a separate b'n'b (Criccieth looks very walkable / staggerable), the cost of which we split between us so everyone has 'a nice bed' for the holiday
14/04/2022, 20:45 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
14/04/2022, 20:45 - Sam Lea: how does that sit conceptually
14/04/2022, 20:45 - Sam Lea: as 'a sort of thing'
14/04/2022, 20:46 - Sam Lea: we'd be looking at ¬£100ish / ¬£108 each
14/04/2022, 20:46 - Sam Lea: (which is still cheaper than ¬£300pp)
14/04/2022, 20:49 - Aaron Ayling: For me the appeal is us all staying together for a good hangout before I go
14/04/2022, 20:50 - Aaron Ayling: Is at George's Uncle place?
14/04/2022, 20:51 - Sam Lea: oui oui
14/04/2022, 20:51 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah if we were at George's uncles I would happily stay on a blow up or sofa
14/04/2022, 20:52 - Reuben Yarwood: In lieu of someone staying in a BnB, agreed that we should all stay together
14/04/2022, 20:53 - Aaron Ayling: Or if we did get the Airbnb I'd want to stay in the fun house at least
14/04/2022, 20:53 - Aaron Ayling: Anyway, don't overly care, just would like to get this sorted
14/04/2022, 20:53 - Reuben Yarwood: I feel your reticence about Blackpool Sam but I think as long as everyone is fine with it potentially being naff then it'll be fun
14/04/2022, 20:54 - Reuben Yarwood: *naff weather
14/04/2022, 20:54 - Reuben Yarwood: Obv also possible anywhere
14/04/2022, 20:56 - Reuben Yarwood: I realise the ¬£¬£¬£ is also an issue
14/04/2022, 20:56 - Sam Lea: I mean I wouldn't hate a few spins on the pepsi max!
14/04/2022, 21:16 - James Kemp: So basically nothing is clear still LOL
14/04/2022, 21:17 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm happy with either just want a decision?
14/04/2022, 21:17 - James Kemp: Ready to just withdraw and let Jesus take the wheel coz a bit bored of organization chat
14/04/2022, 21:17 - James Kemp: Someone decide and lmk
14/04/2022, 21:24 - Aaron Ayling: Alright for the sake of having a decision and as I am also bored of trying to organise this let's do George's Uncle's place (if that is still okay George!)
14/04/2022, 21:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Happy with that
14/04/2022, 21:25 - +44 7462 872590: I am happy with that
14/04/2022, 21:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Plus we can put that ¬£2100 spare towards drugs
14/04/2022, 21:25 - Aaron Ayling: Happy to pay into a supplementary Airbnb if desired, but would rather stay in the good house!
14/04/2022, 21:25 - James Kemp: Yep let‚Äôs just do it
14/04/2022, 21:26 - James Kemp: Can we give @447940330084 the shittest bed
14/04/2022, 21:26 - James Kemp: (Love you Ed ‚ù§Ô∏è)
14/04/2022, 21:26 - Reuben Yarwood: Thanks you George for returning to Wales!
14/04/2022, 21:27 - Aaron Ayling: We can figure out car situatiins in a couple of weeks, happy to train up to macc with you @447725504296 if that's where you'd pick up your mum's car from
14/04/2022, 21:28 - Aaron Ayling: And yeah thanks x1, 000,000 @447462872590 for both the sweet pad and returning to Wales x x x x
14/04/2022, 21:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Let's hope this old lady is a bit deaf
14/04/2022, 21:29 - +44 7752 359588: Just give her ¬£2000 worth of drugs
14/04/2022, 21:29 - Reuben Yarwood: Lollll
14/04/2022, 21:30 - +44 7462 872590: Here are the sleeping arrangements:
14/04/2022, 21:30 - +44 7462 872590: Main bedroom super king bed (with en suite) - Couple
Front bedroom king size bed - Couple
Rear bedroom two single beds - 2 people
Mattress in Snug (Single) - 1 person
Blow-up bed in lounge - George
14/04/2022, 21:30 - +44 7462 872590: So is that enough beds?
14/04/2022, 21:31 - +44 7752 359588: Think we only need the air mattress when Ella is there
14/04/2022, 21:31 - +44 7752 359588: Also I would strongly contest that George should not have the crappest bed
14/04/2022, 21:31 - James Kemp: I will sleep on knives if it means we‚Äôre done organizing?
14/04/2022, 21:31 - +44 7752 359588: After giving us this place and going back to wales
14/04/2022, 21:31 - +44 7752 359588: And I will shame all of us to make that happen
14/04/2022, 21:31 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha no worries, the blow up mattress is actually good
14/04/2022, 21:32 - Sam Lea: secretly the best bed ;)
14/04/2022, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: NO AIR MATTRESS FOR GEORGE
14/04/2022, 21:32 - James Kemp: Yeah let‚Äôs rank how annoying we each were in this process and correlate it to bed quality
14/04/2022, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: Also maybe we can get your uncle some nice wine or something as a thank you?
14/04/2022, 21:32 - James Kemp: Love you all hehehe
14/04/2022, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe some fine drugs?
14/04/2022, 21:33 - Sam Lea: That's me in the garden on a pile of leaves, then... üçÇ
14/04/2022, 21:41 - +44 7752 359588: That's me in the corner... That's me on the AIR MATTRESS... losing my vacation...
14/04/2022, 21:42 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
14/04/2022, 21:43 - Aaron Ayling: Also guess we can be flexible on dates? We blocked out 4th-15th July.

Any preferences? I'd lean earlier so we have the end of July to pack shit for US.

Up on Monday 4th July, back on Monday 11th?
14/04/2022, 21:43 - James Kemp: I can do any time in this range üëåüèª
14/04/2022, 21:43 - James Kemp: Any happy for you to dictate
14/04/2022, 21:44 - James Kemp: My only insistence is we do a murder mystery one night üôà
14/04/2022, 21:45 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah sounds good. I'll double check the availability
14/04/2022, 21:45 - Aaron Ayling: Very down!
14/04/2022, 21:45 - +44 7462 872590: Yes.
14/04/2022, 21:46 - +44 7752 359588: YES
14/04/2022, 21:46 - +44 7752 359588: FINALLY
14/04/2022, 21:46 - +44 7752 359588: I've been edged for years
14/04/2022, 21:47 - James Kemp: No comment ü§≠
14/04/2022, 21:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Yessssss
14/04/2022, 21:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe some mild costume
14/04/2022, 21:49 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll find us a kit over the next few weeks!
14/04/2022, 21:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Would anyone be up for doing Mount Snowden?
14/04/2022, 21:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice one!!
14/04/2022, 21:50 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah!
14/04/2022, 21:50 - Sam Lea: Yes!
14/04/2022, 21:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Sick.
14/04/2022, 21:50 - James Kemp: What‚Äôs the difficulty level?
14/04/2022, 21:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Easy, just a lot of up
14/04/2022, 21:50 - Reuben Yarwood: Me and Ella did it
14/04/2022, 21:51 - James Kemp: Yeah sure then
14/04/2022, 21:51 - +44 7752 359588: I'd be well down, just leave me when my lungs go
14/04/2022, 21:52 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll stay with you üòò
14/04/2022, 21:56 - +44 7462 872590: Yep!
14/04/2022, 21:56 - +44 7752 359588: As we know from seven sisters I'm very slow on an incline
14/04/2022, 21:56 - +44 7462 872590: I've done it, it's not that hard
14/04/2022, 21:58 - James Kemp: But when you park ;)
14/04/2022, 21:58 - James Kemp: Peak

15/04/2022, 07:22 - +61 474 759 280: Fucking belter of the Good Friday

27/04/2022, 11:05 - Aaron Ayling: He's afghanistani and started his case in Kabul. Think he got resettled here anc changed his case to the London embassy after getting a British passport
27/04/2022, 11:06 - Aaron Ayling: (it was the brexit blue passport that tipped Liz off that we got the wrong one haha)

27/04/2022, 11:09 - Aaron Ayling: that's legit it from this side. Could go and live in America today!
27/04/2022, 11:09 - James Kemp: Meanwhile, I might have shingles?? Thought I‚Äôd pulled a muscle doing yoga but now a rash has appeared and seeming to correspond to shingles symptoms‚Ä¶
27/04/2022, 11:09 - James Kemp: Gonna hit up doc
27/04/2022, 11:09 - +61 474 759 280: Dafuq??
27/04/2022, 11:10 - James Kemp: WOOOOOOOI
27/04/2022, 11:10 - +61 474 759 280: I thought shingles was an old man thing
27/04/2022, 11:10 - Aaron Ayling: Did you get chicken pox as a kid, Jim? Thought that stopped you from getting shingles
27/04/2022, 11:10 - James Kemp: Yeah it largely is but it‚Äôs basically just chicken pox popping up again
27/04/2022, 11:11 - James Kemp: Yep and immunized but apparently she can break through again
27/04/2022, 11:11 - James Kemp: Apparently it‚Äôs generally not a cause for concern - goes away on its own in 2-4 weeks. Just kinda painful!
27/04/2022, 11:11 - James Kemp: As long as I don‚Äôt rub my rash on you or make you drink my pus
27/04/2022, 11:12 - James Kemp: (I don‚Äôt have any yet)
27/04/2022, 11:12 - James Kemp: My self diagnosis might be off obv but seeming to correspond!

28/04/2022, 12:04 - +61 474 759 280: Does anyone know a nurse here?
28/04/2022, 12:05 - +61 474 759 280: Victoria‚Äôs offering $13,000 for them to relocate here for work
28/04/2022, 12:05 - +61 474 759 280: Seems like a pretty sweet deal
28/04/2022, 12:08 - +44 7752 359588: My cousin and her fiance back home are nurses and they're planning on becoming travel nurses for a bit in the states
28/04/2022, 12:08 - +44 7752 359588: Major nurse shortage there and the money is great
28/04/2022, 12:09 - +44 7752 359588: Of course there's a shortage partially because covid was awful for nurses, but also partially because of vaccine mandates
28/04/2022, 12:09 - +44 7752 359588: I feel like a lot of American nurses are actually very dumb?
28/04/2022, 12:10 - +61 474 759 280: Didn‚Äôt know or forgot America brought in mandates
28/04/2022, 12:10 - James Kemp: I also feel like I‚Äôd need more than ¬£7,500 to relocate?
28/04/2022, 12:10 - James Kemp: No shade
28/04/2022, 12:10 - +61 474 759 280: Seems very unamerican/freedomy
28/04/2022, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: In certain industries and employers, yeah
28/04/2022, 12:11 - +44 7752 359588: Guess vaccination rates were just that shite
28/04/2022, 12:14 - +61 474 759 280: Suppose on the assumption you were open to moving anyway
28/04/2022, 12:14 - +61 474 759 280: Rather than going for the cash
28/04/2022, 14:52 - James Kemp: Also re this, turns out there‚Äôs a family history of shingles recurring in adulthood! Brother‚Äôs had it and sister had it twice!
28/04/2022, 14:52 - James Kemp: Broken Kemp genes
28/04/2022, 14:52 - +44 7752 359588: Y'all cursed

09/05/2022, 10:30 - +44 7752 359588: And obviously bringing booze
09/05/2022, 10:31 - James Kemp: If nobody claims this, maybe wear it?!
09/05/2022, 10:31 - James Kemp: I feel like she‚Äôd make a great costume
09/05/2022, 10:31 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúWhat have you come as?‚Äù, ‚Äúmy wall‚Äù
09/05/2022, 10:31 - +44 7752 359588: High fashion

09/05/2022, 13:38 - +44 7752 359588: I WILL DIE
09/05/2022, 13:38 - James Kemp: How are we so high??
09/05/2022, 13:38 - +44 7752 359588: DIE I TELL YOU
09/05/2022, 13:38 - Reuben Yarwood: What the fuck
09/05/2022, 13:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Our song is _terrible_
09/05/2022, 13:38 - +44 7752 359588: It's a bit of a tune but also bitches are basic
09/05/2022, 13:38 - Sam Lea: (Maybe people heard "UK" and thought they were saying "Ukraine"...)
09/05/2022, 13:38 - +44 7752 359588: Ahahaha I see we disagree
09/05/2022, 13:38 - James Kemp: This is a phrase I hope to be repeating several times over the coming months
09/05/2022, 13:38 - +44 7752 359588: I don't see it beating Ukraine
09/05/2022, 13:39 - Sam Lea: Surely, surely not
09/05/2022, 13:39 - +44 7752 359588: ü§≠
09/05/2022, 13:39 - James Kemp: I keep telling you: it‚Äôs not that bad!!!!!!!
09/05/2022, 13:39 - Reuben Yarwood: Maybe people feel bad for last year
09/05/2022, 13:39 - James Kemp: !!!!!!!!!
09/05/2022, 13:39 - +44 7752 359588: But like Italy is also 3, and it's a bit eh
09/05/2022, 13:39 - Reuben Yarwood: It's perhaps because I find the guy so so annoying
09/05/2022, 13:39 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúBeen down some black holes‚Äù is awkward
09/05/2022, 13:40 - Sam Lea: Filth
09/05/2022, 13:40 - James Kemp: Could it also be a thing where the odds are swayed by the number of people betting on it?
09/05/2022, 13:40 - James Kemp: So it could just indicate a lot of people have bet on UK?
09/05/2022, 13:40 - James Kemp: Which feels a very UK punter thing to do?
09/05/2022, 13:40 - James Kemp: (Is this how odds work?)
09/05/2022, 13:52 - Aaron Ayling: If we win Eurovision I'm coming back to London next year
09/05/2022, 13:52 - Sam Lea: This makes it sound like you've otherwise solemnly sworn to never return üòÖ
09/05/2022, 13:53 - Aaron Ayling: Only a Eurovision win can break the curse
09/05/2022, 15:06 - James Kemp: What if
09/05/2022, 15:06 - James Kemp: The leaderboard reflects this list
09/05/2022, 15:06 - James Kemp: Ukraine win, but we come second
09/05/2022, 15:07 - James Kemp: Do we end up hosting if Ukraine can‚Äôt?
09/05/2022, 15:21 - +44 7752 359588: AGHHH
09/05/2022, 15:21 - +44 7752 359588: How does it work???
09/05/2022, 16:17 - +44 7462 872590: Keir Starmer saying he'll step down as leader if the police fine him, is straight out of the Johnny Stowellman Mafia playbook. "Kill me off now then you can kill the real mafia next round... And technically I'm on the winning team."
09/05/2022, 18:40 - James Kemp: Btw @447752359588 - Jenna and Mia are welcome on Sat!

09/05/2022, 19:22 - James Kemp: We absolutely are
09/05/2022, 19:22 - James Kemp: Gotta have a bit of skin in the game
09/05/2022, 19:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Excellent
09/05/2022, 19:23 - James Kemp: I think we might need a first and second place tho? Given how much of a foregone conclusion it seems
09/05/2022, 19:30 - +44 7752 359588: Agreed
09/05/2022, 20:38 - +44 7752 359588: <Media omitted>

10/05/2022, 21:57 - +44 7462 872590: Just an FYI for Saturday, it's the FA Cup final kickoff at 4:45pm. So the pubs will most likely be packed with Chelsea and Liverpool fans.... Don't know which is worse.
10/05/2022, 22:04 - +44 7752 359588: EW
10/05/2022, 22:04 - +44 7752 359588: Why are straight things scheduled the same day as Eurovision?
10/05/2022, 22:05 - Sam Lea: Well, it'll be beforehand
10/05/2022, 22:05 - James Kemp: Yeah we can picnic and then ours
10/05/2022, 22:05 - Sam Lea: So, a lovely tonal contrast
10/05/2022, 22:05 - James Kemp: Shouldn‚Äôt need to face the pub crowd!
10/05/2022, 22:06 - +44 7462 872590: They actually moved the game an hour earlier than planned because of Eurovision!
10/05/2022, 22:07 - +44 7462 872590: Sounds good!

10/05/2022, 22:41 - +44 7752 359588: Switzerland and Armenia going through are CRIMES
10/05/2022, 22:41 - James Kemp: Switzerland was one of my least faves yeah

11/05/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: Want some input into Sat planning plz
11/05/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: Am thinking because of the proportion of veggies/vegans and given how _gross_ vegan jelly shots are, we‚Äôll take jelly shots off the table?
11/05/2022, 11:56 - James Kemp: Do we replace them with owt or do we just want to presume casual drinking will be enough? üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11/05/2022, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: Happy to leave em!
11/05/2022, 11:57 - Aaron Ayling: Cas drinking fine for me!

11/05/2022, 11:59 - +44 7752 359588: Fine either way tbh, could always still do drinking rules, but with your own beer
11/05/2022, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: Could always grab a bottle of something gross and sweet if folks want shots
11/05/2022, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: Hilariously after years of having to order that vegan brand off Amazon, our local sains carries it
11/05/2022, 12:00 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently it's kosher
11/05/2022, 12:01 - James Kemp: Down with this!‚Äô

11/05/2022, 14:20 - +44 7752 359588: Think I was a bit drunk by then, but in the sober light of day it's still a solid A for me
11/05/2022, 14:21 - James Kemp: Also justice for Ela!
11/05/2022, 14:21 - +44 7752 359588: I would rearrange some of these now - the show should be S
11/05/2022, 14:22 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd whack Llameme down to a D üôà
11/05/2022, 14:22 - +44 7752 359588: Barely remember this one anymore ahaha
11/05/2022, 14:22 - James Kemp: (Sorry for attacking all your opinions)
11/05/2022, 14:22 - +44 7752 359588: Llameme is terrible but it gets SO STUCK IN MY HEAD
11/05/2022, 14:22 - +44 7752 359588: So I love it
11/05/2022, 14:22 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs the Cyprus mystical lesbian bitch kinda Turkish energy one?
11/05/2022, 14:22 - +44 7752 359588: Saudade should also be upgraded a tier
11/05/2022, 14:22 - James Kemp: They all smother each other in the video like Solange
11/05/2022, 14:23 - +44 7752 359588: Ahhh yeah
11/05/2022, 14:23 - +44 7752 359588: Was sliiightly bored but opinion could be swayed by the live performance
11/05/2022, 14:24 - James Kemp: Yeah I think it needs to bring good staging to get to a firm A for me
11/05/2022, 14:24 - James Kemp: It just feels very early 00s Eurovision in a way I appreciate
11/05/2022, 23:32 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
11/05/2022, 23:33 - +61 474 759 280: @447752359588 I‚Äôm taking your mum up on her offer to drive me around Aurora

13/05/2022, 09:44 - +44 7752 359588: Loool this man clearly doesn't Eurovision
13/05/2022, 10:03 - Aaron Ayling: This is the dude who once in the middle of an only mildly related discussion said to the group "hands up who's met Helen mirren" then raised his own hand.
13/05/2022, 10:03 - Reuben Yarwood: Nooooooo
13/05/2022, 10:04 - Aaron Ayling: Looking back now I have a bit of respect for it

13/05/2022, 10:37 - +44 7462 872590: "Hands up who's met Helen Mirren" needs to be our Pub Quiz name in the future

13/05/2022, 16:17 - +44 7462 872590: I've got a bet with a work mate. He thinks that the UK will finish in the bottom three. I've gone for UK finishing in the top three üá¨üáß.
13/05/2022, 16:17 - James Kemp: I think you‚Äôre way more likely to win out of that than he is!
13/05/2022, 16:18 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah I'm pretty confident. He's second favourite at the moment. Accounted for a slight slip... Being British and all

14/05/2022, 11:09 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
14/05/2022, 11:10 - Sam Lea: What the absolute fuck
14/05/2022, 11:11 - James Kemp: Seeing speculation that the jury tends to have a track record of undue low scores for ethnic dancey bangers (Ukraine last year, Spirit in the Sky) which might mean a surprise low score for Ukraine from them
14/05/2022, 11:11 - Sam Lea: So jury votes and televotes are weighted equally 50/50?
14/05/2022, 11:11 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm not sure?
14/05/2022, 11:12 - James Kemp: But basically the UK are fucking in it with a pop!!
14/05/2022, 11:12 - James Kemp: No idea what this means but you get me üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
14/05/2022, 11:13 - Sam Lea: loud and clear

14/05/2022, 11:17 - Reuben Yarwood: 2nd this
14/05/2022, 11:18 - James Kemp: I guess press opinion doesn‚Äôt equate to jury opinion
14/05/2022, 11:18 - James Kemp: But a tantalising bit o data anyway!
14/05/2022, 11:33 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah and thre question was "what was your fave performance" so there could be more Ukraine 2nd faves giving them higher points etc etc.
14/05/2022, 11:33 - Aaron Ayling: Plus you only need to look at last year to see the fuckerry the public votes have, but very fun drama to be going into tonight with!
14/05/2022, 11:35 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
14/05/2022, 11:35 - James Kemp: Apparently Ukraine had a bit of a mare with their sound in the jury show also?
14/05/2022, 11:36 - James Kemp: Excited, as you say, it means we might have a competition on our hands!!
14/05/2022, 11:37 - Aaron Ayling: I hear the technical sound stuff at the show is shit this year
14/05/2022, 11:38 - Aaron Ayling: (I hear this from @447595390314)
14/05/2022, 11:38 - James Kemp: Resident Key Change Expert
14/05/2022, 11:38 - Aaron Ayling: A lot of artists complaining / storming off in rehearsals
14/05/2022, 11:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Spicy!
14/05/2022, 11:44 - Aaron Ayling: I'm calling it : I don't think Ukraine will win!
14/05/2022, 11:44 - James Kemp: Then surely we will?!
14/05/2022, 11:45 - Aaron Ayling: Im not saying we necessarily will, I just have a feeling Ukraine won't
14/05/2022, 11:45 - +44 7462 872590: Ooo big!
14/05/2022, 11:45 - +44 7462 872590: Which country won't give Ukraine 12 points... Shade
14/05/2022, 11:45 - James Kemp: If we win, you have to forfeit US citizenship
14/05/2022, 11:45 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs only fair
14/05/2022, 11:47 - James Kemp: Also this was - the question was choose your top five performances
14/05/2022, 11:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Lol
14/05/2022, 11:47 - James Kemp: Only 4% of press put Ukraine in the top FIVE!
14/05/2022, 11:49 - Aaron Ayling: Oh wow!

14/05/2022, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: I'd still be surprised if Ukraine didn't take it, BUT wouldn't that be some drama
14/05/2022, 11:52 - +44 7752 359588: I reckon Aarons right that it'll be high for most countries, both public and jury
14/05/2022, 11:53 - +44 7752 359588: If the UK wins our move to America is CANCELLED
14/05/2022, 11:53 - +44 7462 872590: üòÇ
14/05/2022, 11:53 - +44 7752 359588: (or at least we'll deffo be back for it next year)
14/05/2022, 11:53 - +44 7462 872590: üôèüá¨üáß
14/05/2022, 11:54 - +44 7462 872590: Would be classic UK to win this year and be even more hated for taking it from Ukraine
14/05/2022, 11:54 - +44 7752 359588: Omg but this is the truth
14/05/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: I was thinking this!!
14/05/2022, 11:56 - Aaron Ayling: Haha me too
14/05/2022, 12:04 - Sam Lea: 17th to 22nd spot in the running order has yielded the most winners

21/05/2022, 11:19 - +44 7462 872590: Her legs look too long
21/05/2022, 11:20 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs Eliot‚Äôs dog so something‚Äôs definitely wrong
21/05/2022, 11:45 - Aaron Ayling: Why are you/the dog somewhere you can be woken up by it
21/05/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: Also french bulldogs are now the most popular dog in the world and thus basic bitch trash
21/05/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: Liz said you told me you were dogsitting
21/05/2022, 11:46 - Aaron Ayling: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
21/05/2022, 11:47 - James Kemp: No I actually slept on the streets
21/05/2022, 11:48 - James Kemp: She‚Äôs a random stray
21/05/2022, 12:13 - +44 7752 359588: Is she as much of a bitch as Eliot?
21/05/2022, 12:19 - James Kemp: She kinda sucks yeah
21/05/2022, 12:19 - James Kemp: Ugly frog dog
21/05/2022, 15:46 - Aaron Ayling: Early projections looking good for you @61474759280! ABC projecting she's gonna win it with 53%!
21/05/2022, 15:47 - Aaron Ayling: (Higgins is your seat, right?)
24/05/2022, 07:57 - +61 474 759 280: Sorry for the massive delay. Victory in Higgins is assured
24/05/2022, 07:58 - Aaron Ayling: Nice work!
24/05/2022, 07:58 - Aaron Ayling: How much did you win again?

24/05/2022, 07:59 - Aaron Ayling: Not bad at all
24/05/2022, 07:59 - +44 7462 872590: ü§ë
24/05/2022, 07:59 - +44 7462 872590: Nice!
24/05/2022, 08:03 - +61 474 759 280: It was a big fucking weekend
24/05/2022, 08:11 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
24/05/2022, 09:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Hot damn! High drag.
24/05/2022, 09:23 - James Kemp: Did it go straight on packet
24/05/2022, 09:23 - James Kemp: ?? üëÑ
24/05/2022, 09:59 - James Kemp: Also, why am I _still_ singing ‚Äúh‚Äôola mi bebebe‚Ä¶ llamame llamame‚Äù üíÄ

24/05/2022, 10:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Same
24/05/2022, 10:51 - +44 7752 359588: I told you it was an earwig!!!
24/05/2022, 10:51 - +44 7752 359588: This looks so fancy!
24/05/2022, 10:53 - +61 474 759 280: Thank you. Not sure I ever explained this, I had a wedding to attend on the day of the election
24/05/2022, 10:53 - Reuben Yarwood: I assumed this was you getting very dressed up for the election
24/05/2022, 10:54 - +44 7752 359588: Ahahaha yeah I deadass assumed this was some fancy young labor party
24/05/2022, 10:54 - +61 474 759 280: Hahahaha sorry all
24/05/2022, 10:54 - +44 7752 359588: Or like you'd volunteered so much that you got to go tosome official thing
24/05/2022, 10:54 - +61 474 759 280: No! I was a ring in because a person on the bridal party got COVID
24/05/2022, 10:54 - +44 7752 359588: LOL
24/05/2022, 10:54 - +61 474 759 280: I still had an invite but it was a last second promotion
24/05/2022, 10:55 - +44 7752 359588: So what, you were a last minute groomsman?
24/05/2022, 10:55 - +61 474 759 280: Yep!
24/05/2022, 10:55 - +61 474 759 280: And the COVID dude had my exact suit dimensions
24/05/2022, 10:55 - +44 7752 359588: Honestly, all the hype, but none of the pre-wedding work
24/05/2022, 10:56 - +44 7752 359588: This feels like a cinderella plot
24/05/2022, 10:57 - +44 7462 872590: Coviderella
24/05/2022, 11:07 - James Kemp: Also thought this!
24/05/2022, 11:07 - James Kemp: You getting married to the cause
24/05/2022, 11:12 - Sam Lea: Rapid ascension to the upper echelons of the ALP
24/05/2022, 11:12 - Sam Lea: Schmoozing with the donors

25/05/2022, 11:55 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah sounds about right!

25/05/2022, 12:07 - Reuben Yarwood: üòÇ
25/05/2022, 12:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Are you going to get one too?
25/05/2022, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: No, we didn't so we could feel smug about all the people who are just minding their own business and creating a nice photo for themselves
25/05/2022, 12:08 - Aaron Ayling: *being sheeple sorry
26/05/2022, 12:53 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
26/05/2022, 12:56 - Aaron Ayling: Get it!
26/05/2022, 12:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Sick! Did Frisby get a new landrover?
26/05/2022, 13:00 - +44 7752 359588: What a vibe!
26/05/2022, 13:08 - James Kemp: Yep! Left the old boy in Canada (sold it)
26/05/2022, 13:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah so I thought. Nice one!
26/05/2022, 19:25 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
26/05/2022, 19:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Fear And Loathing Realness!
26/05/2022, 19:28 - +44 7752 359588: THE BUCKET HAT
26/05/2022, 19:28 - +44 7752 359588: Aaron would like the full body shot when you get the chance üòò
26/05/2022, 19:29 - Reuben Yarwood: I bet he would
27/05/2022, 13:34 - Sam Lea: So, if I was a PM at BAE Systems involved in the development of new tanks
27/05/2022, 13:34 - Sam Lea: How would that make you feel about me as a person
27/05/2022, 13:34 - Sam Lea: And that as a career choice
27/05/2022, 13:41 - Aaron Ayling: So I kind of take a "if it wasn't you doing it someone else would be" approach.

Like yeah, it is shit war things are being built and lots of money is being spent on them. Ideally that money would go on more societally beneficial things (or _really_ ideally the concept of money and careers wouldn't even exist, but baby steps) but we live where we do and can only affect so much. I wouldn't write someone off for that being their job.
27/05/2022, 13:42 - Aaron Ayling: That opinion doesn't hold up for stuff like Daily Mail journalist though.
27/05/2022, 13:45 - Reuben Yarwood: I think there is an argument for living the change you want to see in the world. Like I'm not going to start eating meat because the cows are being bred either way
27/05/2022, 13:45 - Sam Lea: Only asking as one of our PMs announced she's leaving this morning, and that's what she's off to do...
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: I actually got headhunted by an oil company to be an editor and obvs didn't go for it
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Although the money would have been better
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Personally would have felt shitty working for them
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Sam Lea: And I found it difficult to know quite to what extent I should be saying "oh great stuff, good luck with the new job!" üòÖ
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Whatever they paid me
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Sam Lea: Yeah
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Sam Lea: Tainted dosh
27/05/2022, 13:46 - Reuben Yarwood: Ha! Hope you design some really lethal tanks
27/05/2022, 13:47 - Sam Lea: Lol
27/05/2022, 13:47 - Reuben Yarwood: I hope your AI can distinguish between the goodies and the baddies
27/05/2022, 13:54 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah fair. I wouldn't do it myself, either. I guess to continue your example do you look down on people who do eat meat? (it is fine to say yes!)
27/05/2022, 13:55 - Aaron Ayling: Or like judge/wouldn't be friends with etc
27/05/2022, 13:56 - Reuben Yarwood: I look down on libertarian guys who eat stake three meals a day yeah. Wouldn't be friends with one.
27/05/2022, 13:57 - Aaron Ayling: https://youtu.be/CTNhCzmUjlw
27/05/2022, 14:00 - Aaron Ayling: But yeah, I definitely feel like more and more I personally need to feel okay with the ethics of the company I work for
27/05/2022, 14:01 - Aaron Ayling: Or rather, it was always important but now it's mega super important,
27/05/2022, 14:02 - Reuben Yarwood: To be fair I'm Future aren't perfect
27/05/2022, 14:02 - Reuben Yarwood: But they're not actively evil, hopefully
27/05/2022, 14:03 - Aaron Ayling: They will have not been perfect
27/05/2022, 14:04 - Aaron Ayling: I'm doing a joke there
27/05/2022, 14:04 - Aaron Ayling: In that I wrote that reply in the future perfect tense
27/05/2022, 14:05 - Aaron Ayling: I was happy with it but understand its a bit niche
27/05/2022, 14:45 - +44 7752 359588: I kind of think that's all we can aim for
27/05/2022, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think I could do it, and while I can understand why someone else could, I would also feel a little gross about them
27/05/2022, 14:48 - Reuben Yarwood: 3 clever 5 me

27/05/2022, 15:39 - +44 7462 872590: Love it!
27/05/2022, 15:39 - +44 7462 872590: Pretty sure that's what the future will be like
27/05/2022, 16:12 - James Kemp: Yeah I loved them so much
27/05/2022, 16:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Amazing

29/05/2022, 13:27 - Reuben Yarwood: Wait is this satire or not??
29/05/2022, 20:46 - Aaron Ayling: Hey gang, if possible can you do a covid test before our party on Wednesday? (either Tuesday eve or Wednesday morning). If you need any we have loads of spares!
30/05/2022, 10:18 - Reuben Yarwood: So imagine you lived down the road from a seshy festival, an dyou found a baggy of white powder on the pavement. Do you:
A) leave it on the floor
B) take it for safe keeping
C) get it doon ye
30/05/2022, 10:19 - +44 7752 359588: THROW IT OUT
30/05/2022, 10:19 - +44 7752 359588: I'm not taking a lucky dip with a random baggy
30/05/2022, 10:20 - Reuben Yarwood: Interesting
30/05/2022, 10:21 - Sam Lea: Maybe give it a quick once-over with a testing kit...?
30/05/2022, 10:21 - +61 474 759 280: I would test it with a pinkie dip like the cops do
30/05/2022, 10:22 - Reuben Yarwood: So I picked it up and was like "wow this is a full bag of packet" and then chucked it back on the floor
30/05/2022, 10:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Now wondering if that was the wrong decision
30/05/2022, 10:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Esp as I'm not sure that I'll get any supplies for Weds
30/05/2022, 10:22 - Reuben Yarwood: But Liz I think you are right
30/05/2022, 10:25 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I only vote throw it out because I'm now old and worry about the youths
30/05/2022, 10:26 - Sam Lea: The voice of reason
30/05/2022, 10:30 - Aaron Ayling: I'd probably keep it and introduce it as a wildcard party element
30/05/2022, 10:33 - Aaron Ayling: Dr Muller.vcf (file attached)
30/05/2022, 10:33 - Aaron Ayling: ^this guy is good if anyone does want to get owt for/on Wednesday!

30/05/2022, 13:48 - James Kemp: Obviously a tornado but together!
30/05/2022, 13:48 - James Kemp: With a few nice visuals in there
31/05/2022, 18:08 - Sam Lea: K chaps, just sorting out the rest of me summer - George booked us in for 4th to the 11th, is that we all locked in? Was everyone able to get those days off etc.
31/05/2022, 18:08 - Sam Lea: (Wales in July, this is)
31/05/2022, 18:10 - Sam Lea: And to confirm what we spoke about after Mando's, is the plan for Reuben and I to drive? Definitely no Beesleymobile
31/05/2022, 19:05 - +44 7462 872590: Yep Monday 4th - Monday 11th. I've booked that time off work.
31/05/2022, 19:07 - Aaron Ayling: I didn't catch the "definitely no Beesley mobile" part! I thought Ed was gonna check and if not Reuben?
31/05/2022, 19:40 - Edward Beesley: Yeh I'm going to check on the potential Beesley mobile sitch
31/05/2022, 20:32 - Reuben Yarwood: So my parents need the car now for a wedding that weekend
31/05/2022, 20:33 - Reuben Yarwood: Just looked it up. Hiring a 7 seater for those 8 days, we're talking ¬£950 plus fuel and probs insurance premiums
31/05/2022, 20:33 - Reuben Yarwood: 3 of us could still get a return to Macc and take the van
31/05/2022, 20:34 - Reuben Yarwood: And the other 4 in Sam's pending MOT? Sam do you think your car will pass with no probs? Cause that could actually add up
01/06/2022, 10:41 - James Kemp: @447912940213 @447752359588 - I am recovered and ready to party!! What time did you want us from this eve?!
01/06/2022, 10:43 - Aaron Ayling: Officially starting from 6 but we'll be there from 5.30 if you wanna come then!
01/06/2022, 11:45 - +44 7752 359588: Also if anyone happens to have a usb-c to audio av
01/06/2022, 11:46 - +44 7752 359588: Would be very appreciated
01/06/2022, 11:46 - +44 7752 359588: Basically the thing that gives your phone a headphone jack if needed
01/06/2022, 11:47 - Sam Lea: Hmmm, I have several headphone jack to stereo phone cables...
01/06/2022, 11:47 - Sam Lea: But not USB C
01/06/2022, 11:47 - Sam Lea: Tim Cook is not welcome in this house
01/06/2022, 11:47 - Sam Lea: *phono
01/06/2022, 12:04 - +44 7752 359588: I don't even own an iphone, it's an evil google phone instead üò≠
01/06/2022, 12:07 - Sam Lea: Is it a Spoti playlist? I can bring a spare phone / laptop
01/06/2022, 12:07 - Sam Lea: (that has a headphone jack out)
01/06/2022, 12:07 - James Kemp: Currently rummaging under the bed for you but no luck so far!!

01/06/2022, 12:11 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
01/06/2022, 12:11 - James Kemp: USB to audio jack connected to a USBC adapter?

01/06/2022, 12:13 - James Kemp: I think I have failed üôÇ
01/06/2022, 12:15 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
01/06/2022, 12:16 - Sam Lea: this is what I have anyway (bottom one can go into a phone/laptop with regular headphone jack)
01/06/2022, 12:17 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah they won't work, cheers though guys. Not a huge deal as I have a 3.5mm av jack on my phone!
01/06/2022, 12:19 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah it was more for back up, but cheers guys, I'm sure Aarons will be fine
01/06/2022, 13:59 - +44 7752 359588: Ahhh and the adapter we ordered from Amazon magically arrived on time!

06/06/2022, 10:47 - Aaron Ayling: Yep, but if he _just_ survives it it really hampers his authority
06/06/2022, 10:47 - Aaron Ayling: Which means the tories are worries he'd throw a "toys out the pram snap election"
06/06/2022, 10:48 - Aaron Ayling: Instead of resigning and letting someone else take over, go nuclear and fuck his own team
06/06/2022, 10:51 - Sam Lea: You'd think he has more chance of losing a GE now than he would in 2024 when things are (presumably) on a bit more or an even-keel, and all the misdeeds that are currently fresh in everyone's minds will have faded?

08/06/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: Honestly one of my fave meme subgenres
08/06/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: A perfectly cut animal scream = nut city bitch
08/06/2022, 12:14 - +44 7752 359588: Were we about to get a cut of I will always love you???
08/06/2022, 12:14 - +44 7752 359588: Iconic
08/06/2022, 14:42 - Aaron Ayling: Okay guys, about 3 weeks til Wales. Still need to 100% confirm how we're getting there.

@447940330084 have you been able to confirm if you can grab the in-laws car for that week?
09/06/2022, 07:54 - +61 474 759 280: I don‚Äôt want to get in the way of your planning but I just successfully fixed my leaky shower tap by learning how they work from YouTube videos
09/06/2022, 09:01 - James Kemp: I feel so hetero when this happens
09/06/2022, 09:01 - James Kemp: Also @447940330084 what‚Äôs good? We got wheels for Wales?
09/06/2022, 09:05 - Reuben Yarwood: On my end we have a van with me driving + two seats in the front (and a bed in the back if you want!)
09/06/2022, 09:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Or I can hire a car from London
09/06/2022, 09:05 - Reuben Yarwood: Prices to follow...
09/06/2022, 09:06 - Aaron Ayling: Sweet we'll use this as the backup plan, let's confirm if Ed can borrow the car as that's plan a for now.
09/06/2022, 09:08 - Reuben Yarwood: Train travel for three = 73 x 3 + 80 (?) for fuel = ¬£300 each
09/06/2022, 09:08 - Sam Lea: If we ended up being completely carless, what would the plan be? Trains to and from Criccieth then possibly hire a car locally?
09/06/2022, 09:08 - Reuben Yarwood: Sorry ¬£300 between 3 so ¬£100 each
09/06/2022, 09:09 - Reuben Yarwood: Hire car looking v expensive at the moment
09/06/2022, 09:09 - Aaron Ayling: No plan for this, this location was chosen based on the fact we'd drive
09/06/2022, 09:10 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
09/06/2022, 09:11 - Reuben Yarwood: So 200 each with a full 5 person car
09/06/2022, 09:11 - Reuben Yarwood: Although we can shop around
09/06/2022, 09:12 - Aaron Ayling: Lets worry about this once @447940330084 has confirmed either way.

Here's the sitch as I see it:

If we have to hire a care the whole holiday group will split the cost
09/06/2022, 09:12 - James Kemp: I guess if it comes to that, it‚Äôs at least offset by free accom
09/06/2022, 09:12 - Aaron Ayling: Ah sorry was writing a second  message and didn't delete the first one
09/06/2022, 09:16 - Aaron Ayling: Here's the sitch as I see it:

Car 1 - Sam's car. He's holding on to this for this trip and will sell it after. It needs an mot but should be ¬£200 total and I'm happy to split that.

Car 2 - Either:
a) Ed's in laws'
b) reuben's truck

If it's b) Liz and I are happy to train up to macc and go with reubs if needed.
09/06/2022, 09:26 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
09/06/2022, 09:26 - Reuben Yarwood: More roomy than it looks but there are two seats in the front there
09/06/2022, 09:27 - Reuben Yarwood: But the drive should be approx 3 hours instead of 5
09/06/2022, 09:28 - Reuben Yarwood: More like 6 actually
09/06/2022, 09:28 - +61 474 759 280: What
09/06/2022, 09:28 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah the drive from London will take like 6 hours depending on when we leave
09/06/2022, 09:29 - Aaron Ayling: It's a super van that goes twice as fast
09/06/2022, 09:31 - Reuben Yarwood: I usually chuck a police siren on there and floor it all the way
09/06/2022, 09:32 - Aaron Ayling: Solve some mysteries on the way
09/06/2022, 09:32 - James Kemp: Mystery 1: where is @447940330084 ??
09/06/2022, 09:34 - +61 474 759 280: I was more bugeyed at the commute estimates going from 5 to 3 to 6, that said, not saying 6 is a crazy commute though
09/06/2022, 09:35 - Aaron Ayling: 6 from London, 3 from Macc
09/06/2022, 09:35 - +61 474 759 280: Ooooooooh
09/06/2022, 10:07 - Edward Beesley: Hello Lads
09/06/2022, 10:11 - Edward Beesley: I've been chasing up the car sitch but there were several moving parts and took until now to confirm for sure... But the verdict is yes, I can borrow a car. I'd probably need to have it back on 10th July (Sunday) though, which i think might be a day earlier than originally thought? Anyway, if two others wanted to come back on Sunday evening then that would work
09/06/2022, 10:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice!
09/06/2022, 10:12 - Reuben Yarwood: I wouldn't mind coming back Sunday
09/06/2022, 10:14 - James Kemp: Yep me neither!
09/06/2022, 10:14 - James Kemp: So does everyone have a car space?
09/06/2022, 10:16 - +44 7752 359588: Assuming Sam's MOT goes ahead? Yes?
09/06/2022, 10:16 - +44 7752 359588: Also assuming both of these cars are like normal 5 seaters
09/06/2022, 10:17 - Edward Beesley: Yeh, mine will certainly take four; five at a push of needed
09/06/2022, 10:18 - +44 7752 359588: Then I think we're good!
09/06/2022, 10:18 - +44 7462 872590: üòé
09/06/2022, 10:18 - +44 7462 872590: Cheers for organising team
09/06/2022, 10:19 - James Kemp: Idgaf who I travel with but I am very entertaining so if we‚Äôre talking a long journey, you probably want me in your car üíã
09/06/2022, 10:20 - James Kemp: Also down for road head
09/06/2022, 10:20 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm up for getting insured on one of the cars if that helps
09/06/2022, 10:20 - Reuben Yarwood: And if it ain't too pricey
09/06/2022, 10:22 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I assume Sam will take all the south Londoners and Ed will take Aaron and I? Just like location-wise and all
09/06/2022, 10:22 - Aaron Ayling: Cheers hun, very appreciated ‚ô•
09/06/2022, 10:22 - James Kemp: Works for me!!

09/06/2022, 10:39 - James Kemp: Even if it were the best 1 bed ever, that does seem like crazy money

09/06/2022, 10:44 - +44 7752 359588: Its also way smaller than that pic implies
09/06/2022, 10:44 - Aaron Ayling: Not really worth it for me
09/06/2022, 10:44 - Aaron Ayling: It's like the bare minimum to be legally allowed to say "some with a free pool!"

18/06/2022, 23:10 - James Kemp: We made it! And escaped the jaws of death so luckily
18/06/2022, 23:11 - James Kemp: They invited most people with hand luggage (including us) to check their hand luggage. We didn‚Äôt, AND THEN THEY LOST ALL THE LUGGAGE.
18/06/2022, 23:11 - James Kemp: Arrived with half the bags whilst we (luckily) breezed straight through!

19/06/2022, 08:25 - Aaron Ayling: I think it's coz I wasn't expecting them?
19/06/2022, 08:26 - +44 7462 872590: üòç looks amazing!

23/06/2022, 12:04 - +44 7462 872590: Okay team, for the trip to Criccieth from the 4th could we all bring own towels. And for those who aren't in a double bed could you bring bedding. Apparently the best restaurant in town is Dylans, so we could book a dinner there one night if ya fancy (although it might already be booked up). My uncle is gonna meet us at the place on Monday and he'll know the best places to go.
23/06/2022, 12:16 - +44 7462 872590: Oh, and if someone has a portable speak for music on the balcony, that would be great
23/06/2022, 12:21 - Sam Lea: I was thinking we could bring our speakers from the flat too, maybe...?
23/06/2022, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Cheers! Was gonna ask about sheets!

If I remember correctly, was the breakdown of beds 2 x king, 2 x singles, 1 x cot? So does this mean we need sheets for the kings or the singles?
23/06/2022, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: I also have my shitty Bluetooth speaker, happy to bring that. And also weirdly our camping grill if we want that
23/06/2022, 12:23 - +44 7752 359588: Also I saw this yesterday - it's amazing
23/06/2022, 12:23 - Sam Lea: No other version of man
23/06/2022, 12:23 - +61 474 759 280: While we‚Äôre on speakers, I still use the portable speaker I got from this group on my 30th ü•Ç
23/06/2022, 12:24 - +61 474 759 280: I spilled pumpkin soup all over it but it hasn‚Äôt held it back at all
23/06/2022, 12:25 - Sam Lea: For that rich, soupy tone
23/06/2022, 12:25 - +44 7752 359588: Ahaha amazing. I think mine is a very similar model
23/06/2022, 12:25 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
23/06/2022, 12:25 - James Kemp: Don‚Äôt mind which bed I get!
23/06/2022, 12:25 - James Kemp: Happy to go single if it makes things easier
23/06/2022, 12:26 - +61 474 759 280: Iconique
23/06/2022, 12:26 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah, so there is bedding for the King. But yeah the double and the two singles we might need bedding for.
23/06/2022, 12:26 - James Kemp: ü•∞
23/06/2022, 12:27 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah, mines a plug in so not sure how far it'd reach outside
23/06/2022, 12:32 - Sam Lea: Ah yeah, meant more for indoor boogyin'
23/06/2022, 12:33 - James Kemp: Yeeeeeeeah!!
23/06/2022, 12:33 - James Kemp: Will get onto murder mystery organizing when I‚Äôm back also
23/06/2022, 12:34 - +44 7462 872590: YES!
23/06/2022, 12:36 - Aaron Ayling: Was also thinking maybe we wanna get a supermarket delivery for Tuesday?
23/06/2022, 12:37 - +44 7752 359588: I'll have a rifle around at home - we definitely have a spare fitted queen sheet (which would be loose on the double) and we might have a spare double. Pretty sure we have a spare duvet knocking around too
23/06/2022, 12:37 - James Kemp: Yeah wise
23/06/2022, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: I have a speaker too for outside. Not bovved about a single
23/06/2022, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Thanks man!!

23/06/2022, 12:39 - Aaron Ayling: Yes plz all ours are in the US
23/06/2022, 12:39 - James Kemp: I got 6 player Catan dontchu forget!
23/06/2022, 12:39 - James Kemp: K so I will likely be in touch Sun with grocery planning sheet
23/06/2022, 12:40 - James Kemp: Anyone feel free to chuck ideas on here before then and I will make sure to integrate
23/06/2022, 12:40 - +44 7752 359588: Except risk üôÉ
23/06/2022, 12:43 - +44 7752 359588: Also George, if your uncle is meeting us, I still say we get him a nice gift. You said he doesn't drink? Is there anything else he likes?
23/06/2022, 12:44 - +44 7752 359588: And also, does everyone here have Monzo? We could get a tab going?
23/06/2022, 12:44 - +44 7752 359588: Ps how gross was the flavor dani chose?
23/06/2022, 12:46 - James Kemp: Omg he chose this salty passion fruit shit - not his usual bullshit but still absolutely nasty
23/06/2022, 12:46 - James Kemp: üíÄ
23/06/2022, 12:47 - James Kemp: (You know him well)

23/06/2022, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: Every time we saw a bright blue or rainbow ice cream in Sweden, I thought of him
23/06/2022, 12:50 - James Kemp: Yeah we haven‚Äôt reached the heights of Smurf ice cream
23/06/2022, 12:50 - James Kemp: Yet
23/06/2022, 13:36 - +44 7462 872590: Yep, let me have a think and get back to you
23/06/2022, 14:00 - +44 7752 359588: Cool! Could just be a posh food hamper or a gift certificate to a restaurant or something
23/06/2022, 14:00 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
23/06/2022, 14:10 - Reuben Yarwood: Waittose/John Lewis voucher?

23/06/2022, 14:33 - +44 7462 872590: Actually, he lives mostly at his girlfriend's place in Macclesfield so if you guys know of a nice shop or restaurant in Mac we could get him vouchers for that!
23/06/2022, 14:35 - Aaron Ayling: Fiesta Kebab vouchers it is
23/06/2022, 14:50 - Edward Beesley: Sutton Hall could be a good shout?
23/06/2022, 14:54 - Reuben Yarwood: üòÇ
23/06/2022, 15:30 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah, not bad at all!
23/06/2022, 15:34 - Aaron Ayling: <Media omitted>
23/06/2022, 15:34 - Aaron Ayling: (was just seeing if they even did vouchers, they do)
23/06/2022, 15:35 - +44 7752 359588: Man, Macclesfield is the place to be
23/06/2022, 16:04 - +44 7462 872590: Looks good!

25/06/2022, 10:08 - James Kemp: I appreciate that his swag peaks and dips
25/06/2022, 10:08 - James Kemp: Relatable
25/06/2022, 14:33 - Sam Lea: A steady upward trend nontheless
25/06/2022, 22:29 - +44 7752 359588: Every time I see Michael Gove referred to as the levelling up secretary, I laugh
25/06/2022, 22:29 - +44 7752 359588: It's just such a fake title
25/06/2022, 22:29 - +44 7752 359588: Trying to be hip with the youths
25/06/2022, 23:18 - Aaron Ayling: Michael Gove just grinding the Elite 4 over and over again
26/06/2022, 11:51 - James Kemp: okay guys i've very very cursorily started us a grocery ordering list for wales: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VpNwpXUK3qtLPVvSQdPtupQ3FWO3S3UN08n9FocfSuM/edit#gid=0
26/06/2022, 11:52 - James Kemp: i figured the fairest/easiest way to do it was just have breakfast/lunch as a self-serve sitch, and we each take charge of dinner for one night
26/06/2022, 11:53 - James Kemp: presuming we order the groceries to arrive on the tues, that's five nights of dinner to cover, so if we take one each (aaron and liz paired up; george gets a free pass for sorting the house!)
26/06/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: would be good if y'all could jump into the sheet and add not only what we'll need to order for the night you're cooking dinner, but also any other general bits! feels super hard to predict quantity for 7 people over 5 nights, so i personally have started erring on the side of over-ordering
26/06/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: and OBV if anyone has another suggested way to do this, go ahead and lmk!!
26/06/2022, 11:54 - James Kemp: maybe we set a deadline of end of tues to complete, so we can then order and get delivery slot booked a week in advance?
26/06/2022, 11:55 - +61 474 759 280: <Media omitted>
26/06/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: GIMME THE GOON

26/06/2022, 11:57 - +61 474 759 280: Takes me back to my childhood
26/06/2022, 11:59 - James Kemp: also idk wtf to do about lunch
26/06/2022, 11:59 - James Kemp: so yeah, all input welcome
26/06/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: finally, aware we got veggie/vegans tastes to balance, so please bear that in mind!!
26/06/2022, 12:02 - James Kemp: (@447462872590 feel free to add any vegan alternatives to the shit i've missed)
26/06/2022, 12:19 - +44 7752 359588: @447585334190 U R A STAR
26/06/2022, 12:20 - +44 7752 359588: Tuesday deadline for initial order would be great, but we can actually tweak the order til Monday night
26/06/2022, 12:20 - +44 7752 359588: Also, there are a ton of big grocery stores 10-15 mins away, so we can always send an expedition
26/06/2022, 12:21 - +44 7752 359588: But I feel you on predicting quantities, genuinely have no idea
26/06/2022, 12:21 - Aaron Ayling: Yep this is the T, book in any order and you can alter it massively right up to the night before
26/06/2022, 12:22 - +44 7752 359588: Also Jim, I fully expected you to be serving us tortellini for your night, I see you're really treating us
26/06/2022, 12:23 - Aaron Ayling: @447585334190 can you add another tab - "who's bringing what"

We can use it to list what we need to bring (and who's bringing it)
26/06/2022, 12:24 - Aaron Ayling: Doesn't need to look pretty, just don't think I have editing permissions that allow another worksheet
26/06/2022, 12:26 - Aaron Ayling: Also also @447462872590 is there a BBQ, coz that changes what I would cook (want a BBQ night if poss!)
26/06/2022, 12:28 - Aaron Ayling: I'll do a breakfast or two for the group (eg omelette bar) a day or two to make up for Liz and I budding up
26/06/2022, 12:35 - James Kemp: have added and also extended edit permissions so you should be able to add anything!
26/06/2022, 12:36 - James Kemp: i am really pushing the boat out and making an incredibly complex meal of risotto
26/06/2022, 12:40 - Aaron Ayling: don't think you've added me? aaronayl1@gmail.com?
26/06/2022, 12:40 - James Kemp: It should be open to any viewer
26/06/2022, 12:41 - Aaron Ayling: got it cheerrs
26/06/2022, 12:41 - James Kemp: Do yo thang, sis
26/06/2022, 12:41 - James Kemp: I will come back and add more bits as I think of them!
26/06/2022, 12:42 - James Kemp: Just wanted to get us set up for now
26/06/2022, 12:44 - Reuben Yarwood: How does everyone feel about a jackfruit mol√©? Made it once and it was banging. I can get the jackfruit down the road but will add the rest to the list
26/06/2022, 12:45 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm DTJ!
26/06/2022, 12:45 - James Kemp: Down to _jack_
26/06/2022, 12:45 - Aaron Ayling: i have only ever had mole made by a mexican lady and i hated it
26/06/2022, 12:45 - Aaron Ayling: down to have my mind changed by yours though x
26/06/2022, 12:46 - Reuben Yarwood: The recipe I have is basically a chocaletty chilli
26/06/2022, 12:46 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm not inviting opinions on who wants mine
26/06/2022, 12:46 - James Kemp: Because you‚Äôre getting it either way
26/06/2022, 12:46 - Aaron Ayling: yeah same
26/06/2022, 12:46 - James Kemp: üôÉ
26/06/2022, 12:47 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be great!
26/06/2022, 12:48 - Aaron Ayling: also guys please add to the list of shit we may need to bring on that second tab.
@447462872590 - I'll put a question mark next to a few things that i would maybe bring if the place doesn't have it already. Maybe if you check on the list in a couple of days to see if you know off the top of your head if shit's there or not (e.g. coffee making stuff) so you can just answer us all in one go rather than an annoying back and forth
26/06/2022, 12:49 - James Kemp: Does your uncle have 5 grams of md? @447462872590
26/06/2022, 12:50 - Aaron Ayling: joking aside we've got a gram of C a gram of K and some weed i'll be brionging along
26/06/2022, 12:50 - Aaron Ayling: add a drugs tab
26/06/2022, 12:50 - James Kemp: üòà

27/06/2022, 07:02 - +61 474 759 280: No cooking facilities, no laundry, but does have glass perspex shitting cube
27/06/2022, 11:27 - +44 7462 872590: Love they put frosted glass around some of the shower, puts my mind at ease.
27/06/2022, 11:28 - +44 7462 872590: Yep! I'll shoot over some questions. Pretty sure there is a BBQ, but I'll check.
27/06/2022, 11:29 - +44 7462 872590: Not sure about coffee making stuff. There's a kettle obvs.
27/06/2022, 11:34 - +44 7752 359588: Take a shit next to the kitchen
27/06/2022, 11:35 - +44 7462 872590: Circle of life
27/06/2022, 11:36 - +44 7752 359588: We have both a big pour over we can bring, and a coffee machine. How many of y'all are regular coffee drinkers? I realize not everyone is as dependent as me üôÉ
27/06/2022, 11:37 - James Kemp: No coffee for me!!
27/06/2022, 11:38 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah I don't really drink coffee... So not sure what ya need üòÖ
27/06/2022, 11:38 - James Kemp: Might have the occasional cup to stir my weary bones but otherwise not much of a drinker
27/06/2022, 11:39 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah we'll be fine, just weighing up what one to bring!
27/06/2022, 11:40 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm into my morning coff
27/06/2022, 11:54 - Sam Lea: Can I get a confirmed passenger list for the HMS Sam'scar - if she be setting sail with a full complement of souls, we probably need to think carefully about luggage, as the boot space is adequate but not generous
27/06/2022, 11:55 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs me, you, George, Reubs??
27/06/2022, 11:55 - Sam Lea: Ah okay, grand
27/06/2022, 12:46 - +44 7752 359588: @447462872590 - gonna need the address to arrange for a grocery order
27/06/2022, 12:52 - +44 7462 872590: Address is Ednyfed, Lon Felin, Criccieth LL52 0DN
27/06/2022, 12:52 - +44 7752 359588: Thanks bb
27/06/2022, 12:55 - +44 7462 872590: Oh and just one very minor thing while I remember. My uncle is currently in a bit of a dispute with the ice cream shop next door. So if we go there, which we probably will, just don't say we're staying at his place. Not that big of a deal.
27/06/2022, 12:56 - +44 7752 359588: Wait wat
27/06/2022, 12:56 - +44 7752 359588: What is this dispute about
27/06/2022, 12:56 - +44 7752 359588: Enquiring minds need to know
27/06/2022, 12:56 - Aaron Ayling: Love a bit of low stakes drama
27/06/2022, 12:56 - Aaron Ayling: Tits=boobs
27/06/2022, 12:56 - +44 7752 359588: Should we wear sunglasses and hats every time we go into the flat
27/06/2022, 12:59 - Edward Beesley: You'll have to give us the inside _scoop_ on this George
27/06/2022, 13:00 - Aaron Ayling: He's got 99 problems
27/06/2022, 13:00 - +44 7752 359588: A+ pun
27/06/2022, 13:36 - Aaron Ayling: @everyone - I'll go ahead and order a ¬£150 Sutton Hall Voucher for George's Uncle. That'll be ¬£25 per person (sans George) which I think is decent for a week's accom. That cool? I'll start a Monzo tab with it which we can use to track continuing holibob expenses.
27/06/2022, 13:38 - Edward Beesley: Cool - btw, I think the vouchers have to be used all in one go, so if they do smaller sub-amounts it might be worth getting say 3x ¬£50 vouchers instead of 1 x ¬£150. (I know this because my mum recently had a ¬£100 voucher for there and went on her own and obviously had a meal that cost less than that and then couldn't use the voucher, or something like that...)
27/06/2022, 13:39 - Edward Beesley: Might not be an issue but just a thought
27/06/2022, 13:45 - Aaron Ayling: cool will do that!
27/06/2022, 13:47 - +44 7462 872590: Sounds good, thanks for organising it
27/06/2022, 13:49 - +44 7462 872590: I'll pitch in for the voucher as well
27/06/2022, 14:00 - James Kemp: Thanks for organising!!
27/06/2022, 14:01 - James Kemp: Will get back on the shopping order list tonight and add any more bits also
27/06/2022, 14:01 - James Kemp: Shout out to all of y‚Äôall to do the same plzzzzz
27/06/2022, 14:02 - James Kemp: okay guys i've very very cursorily started us a grocery ordering list for wales: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VpNwpXUK3qtLPVvSQdPtupQ3FWO3S3UN08n9FocfSuM/edit#gid=0

27/06/2022, 14:32 - Aaron Ayling: ^for future ref (or if they need printing)

Don't worry about settling the monzo tab just yet, worth keeping it open til we at the end of the holiday
27/06/2022, 14:33 - Reuben Yarwood: Thanks for sorting man
27/06/2022, 15:05 - +44 7752 359588: Have done some on our end
28/06/2022, 10:25 - +44 7752 359588: @447462872590 re: bedding - do we also need to bring the actual duvets/pillows, or just covers/cases
28/06/2022, 11:03 - Sam Lea: I'm partial to a cup of the ol' brown shtuff ;)
28/06/2022, 11:06 - Aaron Ayling: Cool we'll bring our machine!
28/06/2022, 11:08 - +44 7462 872590: Just covers and cases. But myself and one other person should bring duvet and pillow.
28/06/2022, 11:12 - +44 7462 872590: Maybe logistically, Ed can bring a duvet and pillow cause you guys will probs have more space in the car.
28/06/2022, 11:12 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah we have spares, we can bring one in Ed's car!
28/06/2022, 11:13 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
28/06/2022, 11:19 - +44 7752 359588: Thanks! I'll do a final count of bedding we can bring
28/06/2022, 12:47 - +44 7752 359588: Alright - in my continued bedding - I think Aaron and I can provide everything save 1 duvet (which George will bring) and a couple spare pillow cases  (everyone byo? We have 4) and fitted sheets and duvet covers for the 2 singles
28/06/2022, 12:48 - +44 7752 359588: This means we need:
2 x fitted single sheets
2 x single duvet covers (unless we can just go without?)
28/06/2022, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: We do have a spare queen fitted sheet that could be used (just obvs would be loose), and also if anyone has a flat sheet/top sheet, that could definitely be used
28/06/2022, 12:49 - +44 7752 359588: Basically just lmk thoughts and I'll order anything needed from amazon
28/06/2022, 19:23 - James Kemp: Also: never underestimate the size of my emotional baggage
28/06/2022, 19:23 - James Kemp: üôÇ

30/06/2022, 13:47 - Sam Lea: Hello lads, the car just got back from its MOT and it's all set to go for Wales, but it did require some repairs apparently
30/06/2022, 13:49 - Sam Lea: A 7 way split would still be cheaper per person than a return train fare or a hire car, but a) not all of us will be using it for getting to and from Wales, b) I don't feel great asking you all to pay the full amount for it
30/06/2022, 13:50 - Sam Lea: c) there'll still be petrol to pay for, which is spenny atm
30/06/2022, 13:56 - Sam Lea: <Media omitted>
30/06/2022, 13:57 - Sam Lea: I don't really know what to ask for for a contribution, especially as I thought it was going to be a lot cheaper
30/06/2022, 13:58 - Sam Lea: (I'm not going to ask for ¬£70ish each)
30/06/2022, 14:00 - Sam Lea: What seems fair?
30/06/2022, 14:02 - Sam Lea: (And if the answer to that is "the cost of the MOT because you made out like it was likely to pass it without needing repairs", then that's understandable üòÖ)
30/06/2022, 14:35 - Reuben Yarwood: https://youtu.be/_dY-kACvfgc
30/06/2022, 14:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Would anyone be interested in making one night a shitty movie night??
30/06/2022, 14:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Next week
30/06/2022, 15:07 - +44 7462 872590: YES! Dibs playing the "Insanely Jealous Creep"
30/06/2022, 16:08 - Aaron Ayling: Happy to do the full price, 7 way split tbh. ¬£65 each is still cheaper than tickets or renting a car
30/06/2022, 16:08 - Aaron Ayling: Chuck it on the monzo tab, we can sort it at the end of the holiday?
30/06/2022, 16:09 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah obviously no objection to me, as said it's still the cheapest/most convenient transport option
30/06/2022, 16:33 - +44 7462 872590: üëçhappy to chip in
30/06/2022, 16:35 - +44 7462 872590: Glad the cars in one piece üòÖ
30/06/2022, 16:38 - James Kemp: Yep, all fine by me!!
30/06/2022, 16:38 - +44 7752 359588: And also into this
30/06/2022, 16:38 - James Kemp: Also sorry for the lateness in the day - had a hella busy work week and was away last week and also off next week but I have just bought our murder mystery kit!!
30/06/2022, 16:39 - +44 7752 359588: OOOOH üëÄ
30/06/2022, 16:39 - James Kemp: Probs too late for bitches to source costumes (sorrrrrry) but the best one I found was 1920s themed!
30/06/2022, 16:39 - James Kemp: *as was away
30/06/2022, 16:39 - James Kemp: üòÖ

30/06/2022, 16:40 - +44 7752 359588: Honestly also happy to not be buying an outfit as we have enough stuff to get rid of as is
30/06/2022, 16:40 - +44 7752 359588: I hope to play a 1920s gangster with a terrible accent
30/06/2022, 16:41 - James Kemp: üëÑ
30/06/2022, 16:41 - James Kemp: I wanna be a slut
30/06/2022, 16:41 - James Kemp: Flapping my puss around
30/06/2022, 16:41 - +44 7752 359588: Literally the definition of a flapper ey
30/06/2022, 16:49 - Sam Lea: We could do a swift bit of Primin' tonight?
30/06/2022, 16:50 - James Kemp: Oh you totally can!!
30/06/2022, 16:50 - James Kemp: Just sorry I‚Äôve only left you with a couple days!
30/06/2022, 16:54 - +44 7752 359588: Speaking of - my previous message about sheets? Do we need to order some?
30/06/2022, 16:58 - Sam Lea: Will we need 3 single sheets (for the 2 single beds and 1 single mattress in the snug)
30/06/2022, 17:00 - +44 7752 359588: We could use our queen on the twin and then our twin on one of the singles (would all be loose ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
30/06/2022, 17:10 - +44 7462 872590: I don't think you need to order any. You can just use a double on a single.
30/06/2022, 17:13 - +44 7752 359588: Well we only have two spare sheets, so still would need others to bring 2 more
30/06/2022, 17:20 - Sam Lea: I can bring a double sheet
30/06/2022, 17:21 - Sam Lea: I'll do it! I'll volunteer! üèÜü•áüéâ
30/06/2022, 17:28 - Reuben Yarwood: I would say RE this Sam, are you not planning to sell the car after the trip? Selling with an MOT vs selling without means you're probably going to get that money back.
30/06/2022, 17:33 - Sam Lea: That's probably the plan, though it's a pretty old car that won't fetch much
30/06/2022, 17:34 - Sam Lea: The miles it's racked up is pretty eye-watering
30/06/2022, 17:35 - Sam Lea: (Was my granddad's beforehand)
30/06/2022, 17:36 - Sam Lea: But that's a good point, yeah!
30/06/2022, 17:43 - Sam Lea: I'll give the garage a ring tomorrow when they're open and see what they reckon
30/06/2022, 17:44 - James Kemp: Not speaking for the group, but I honestly ain‚Äôt pressed about just paying the full amount. You‚Äôre doing us a huge favor, so happy to just take it as it‚Äôs currently been charged!
30/06/2022, 17:45 - James Kemp: But obv do yo thang!
30/06/2022, 17:45 - +44 7752 359588: Agreed!
30/06/2022, 17:46 - Aaron Ayling: +1
30/06/2022, 18:21 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
30/06/2022, 18:30 - +44 7462 872590: Hey team, just want to hopefully clear some of the bedding situation up. This is what I'm pretty sure is the deal is at my Uncle's place. (Been a bit tricky to get a total straight answer and/or itemized list from him)

Main bedroom super king bed (with en suite) - bedding provided (Because we won't have bedding that fits a super king he's happy for us to use what is there).

Front bedroom king size bed -  sheets provided. Bring double duvet cover and pillow case. (Again we probs won't have sheets for a king double so he's happy for us to use the ones there, the duvet is a double duvet from what I can gather).

Rear bedroom two single beds - Bring sheets, duvet cover, pillow case

Mattress in Snug (Single) - bring duvet, pillow, sheets, duvet cover, pillow case.

George Blow-up bed in lounge - bring duvet, pillow, sheets, duvet cover, pillow case.

Worst come to worst and we are short of bedding, my parents BnB is an hours drive away and they have bedding for days.
30/06/2022, 18:34 - +44 7462 872590: Also... I'm pretty sure there is going to be a mattress in the snug, but if not someone can have my blow-up bed and I'll sleep on the couch. We'll make it work. And I anticipate I'll be yelling at the sea most nights anyway.
30/06/2022, 19:15 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm happy anywhere
30/06/2022, 19:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Would do one of the singles, the snug or the sofa.
30/06/2022, 19:25 - +44 7462 872590: Play your cards right and you might end up on the blow-up mattress with me üòâ
30/06/2022, 19:26 - Aaron Ayling: Will be presumptuous and assume Liz and I will have one if the doubles, but will be bringing spare sheets for others!
30/06/2022, 19:28 - +44 7462 872590: üëçüëç
30/06/2022, 19:30 - Aaron Ayling: Thanks for the rundown George, very appreciated.
30/06/2022, 19:30 - Aaron Ayling: I am pumped!
30/06/2022, 19:30 - +44 7462 872590: üí™can't wait
30/06/2022, 19:30 - Aaron Ayling: Bought Mario Party Superstars, which is a remake/mashup of the first three n64 Mario Party games
30/06/2022, 19:32 - Reuben Yarwood: Nice!
30/06/2022, 19:38 - James Kemp: Omg yes!
30/06/2022, 20:29 - +44 7752 359588: Very very handy!
30/06/2022, 20:29 - +44 7752 359588: Also don't want to speak for everyone else, but maybe two people could share a king so George is on a real mattress? (Or George should just be on a real mattress given he's sorted the housing?)
30/06/2022, 20:35 - James Kemp: I am 100% flexible where I go
30/06/2022, 20:36 - James Kemp: And agree, only the finest bedding for George!
30/06/2022, 20:36 - +44 7752 359588: I also realize it is shady of me to suggest this given Aaron and I will be sharing a bed üòÖ
30/06/2022, 20:37 - +44 7752 359588: Acknowledging my couples privilege
30/06/2022, 20:37 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd honestly be fine in a sleeping bag on the floor so üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è from me!
30/06/2022, 20:38 - +44 7462 872590: I very happy on the blow-up mattress
30/06/2022, 20:38 - James Kemp: We can always make it stakes in night 1‚Äôs drinking game
30/06/2022, 20:38 - James Kemp: Who gets what
30/06/2022, 20:38 - +44 7752 359588: But we've already made you go back to Wales!
30/06/2022, 20:39 - James Kemp: Bonus round: who shares with who
30/06/2022, 20:39 - James Kemp: I want chaos
30/06/2022, 20:39 - +44 7752 359588: When you and Aaron win you can enjoy snuggling in that luxury king bed
30/06/2022, 20:39 - James Kemp: üòà

our cars should probably set off at roughly the same time tomorrow. Thinking like a 10.30ish departure time if that works for everyone? Should get us in by 5pm easily, giving us plenty of settling and party time.
03/07/2022, 10:34 - James Kemp: üëåüèª partyyyyyy
03/07/2022, 10:34 - James Kemp: @447595390314 let‚Äôs figure out best spot for departing from - happy to come to yours if easiest??
03/07/2022, 10:34 - James Kemp: Also does anyone wanna add to the illicits order that Sam‚Äôs gonna be kindly picking up??
03/07/2022, 10:36 - James Kemp: Could get some 2CB if we‚Äôre feeling it?
03/07/2022, 10:37 - Aaron Ayling: I totally am! Don't think doc Muller does that though
03/07/2022, 10:37 - James Kemp: I ain‚Äôt talking about Doc Muller üòâ
03/07/2022, 10:37 - Aaron Ayling: Other drug dealers are available
03/07/2022, 10:38 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
03/07/2022, 10:38 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah totally feeling some 2cb
03/07/2022, 10:44 - Aaron Ayling: Well to keep things in one place, I've asked+sent money for 1g of MD, 3.5g of weed and 4 2cb pills. Won't be using all of that so will contribute to the communal pot!

Also bringing 1g of Ket and 1g of coke (plus a bit more weed teehee).
03/07/2022, 10:45 - Aaron Ayling: Oh and I made Liz bake some weed cookies (she's also baking normal ones)
03/07/2022, 10:45 - James Kemp: Okay cool, I reckon I‚Äôll make the exact same order for myself!
03/07/2022, 10:46 - James Kemp: This guy don‚Äôt open til avo, so Sam I‚Äôll verify you then?
03/07/2022, 10:46 - Sam Lea: Is _Ricky!!_ the go to guy for this then, you reckon?
03/07/2022, 10:46 - James Kemp: He‚Äôs open til midnight so zero rush
03/07/2022, 10:46 - Sam Lea: Super
03/07/2022, 10:46 - James Kemp: He‚Äôs the guy whose md we had before
03/07/2022, 10:46 - Aaron Ayling: Thanks Sam you are the best x x
03/07/2022, 10:46 - Sam Lea: Yep, let me know all the deets and I'll sort
03/07/2022, 10:46 - James Kemp: Could revert to Doc Muller whose weed is better but does no 2Cb
03/07/2022, 10:46 - Sam Lea: No problemo
03/07/2022, 10:46 - Reuben Yarwood: üòç
03/07/2022, 10:47 - James Kemp: Also not sure how Doc Mull‚Äôs md is?
03/07/2022, 10:47 - James Kemp: Haven‚Äôt tried it since it was flour
03/07/2022, 10:47 - Sam Lea: Yeah was just about to say, Reubs wasn't so convinced after Eurovision
03/07/2022, 10:47 - Aaron Ayling: I say stick with Ricky, happy to risk sub par weed for 2cb
03/07/2022, 10:47 - James Kemp: Ricky‚Äôs md pinged me pretty good at Shindig
03/07/2022, 10:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Could have been because I was already hammered? Would be cool to test it at some point
03/07/2022, 10:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Those bombs you have me were good Jim was that Ricky?
03/07/2022, 10:48 - James Kemp: Yep
03/07/2022, 10:49 - James Kemp: So far then, our amalgamated contribution to order is:

- 2g md
- 7g weed
- 8 x 2Cb pills
03/07/2022, 10:49 - James Kemp: I will send you money for my half!
03/07/2022, 11:42 - Sam Lea: Have we got any 5HTP / mag
03/07/2022, 11:43 - Sam Lea: And a some ginger capsules might be a good idea too for the 2CB nausea
03/07/2022, 11:43 - +44 7752 359588: We have some 5htp here
03/07/2022, 11:43 - +44 7752 359588: (we take it for normal sleep)
03/07/2022, 12:13 - Reuben Yarwood: I'll bring 5htp too
03/07/2022, 12:54 - James Kemp: Can also bring some
03/07/2022, 12:54 - James Kemp: Drowning in 5htp
03/07/2022, 13:01 - +44 7752 359588: Also not to sound like your mum (or really more like my dad)... I know we discussed maybe doing Snowdon - if we are, make sure to bring appropriate clothing!
03/07/2022, 13:01 - +44 7752 359588: Websites recommend hiking boots if you have them, and plenty of layers including waterproof ones
03/07/2022, 13:03 - +44 7752 359588: This is just per the internet tho -reubs maybe you can weigh in
03/07/2022, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: (and George)
03/07/2022, 13:04 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
03/07/2022, 13:06 - +44 7462 872590: I have done Snowden twice... It's not that hard if ya pick the right route. I didn't in just normal running shoes, but if ya have hiking boots then great. But yeah a waterproof jacket might be a good idea. Also we should look into booking a parking slot which I think you can do.
03/07/2022, 13:06 - +44 7462 872590: * I did it in just normal running shoes
03/07/2022, 13:07 - +44 7752 359588: Fab!
03/07/2022, 13:07 - +44 7752 359588: Does one actually need gloves in the summer? That seemed a bit over the top to me, but multiple websites said so
03/07/2022, 13:08 - +44 7462 872590: No, I did it in jeans, t-shirt, non waterproof jacket. It was fine.
03/07/2022, 13:08 - +44 7462 872590: If it begins to get a bit hairy we can just turn round and go back.
03/07/2022, 13:09 - +44 7462 872590: There is a train that goes to the top and down as well. And a cafe at the summit.
03/07/2022, 13:09 - +44 7462 872590: There are like 5 year kids and 75 year old grandparents that do it. It's not that bad.
03/07/2022, 13:10 - Aaron Ayling: We'll be reet üí™
03/07/2022, 13:11 - +44 7462 872590: Knock them off on our way to victory
03/07/2022, 13:14 - +44 7752 359588: Thanks for the sitrep
03/07/2022, 13:14 - +44 7462 872590: The most difficult thing will be getting there
03/07/2022, 13:18 - +44 7462 872590: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/caernarfon/s/llanberis-caernarfon-ll55-4nu/?countryCode=uk&citySlug=caernarfon/
03/07/2022, 13:18 - +44 7462 872590: The pre booking carpark website
03/07/2022, 13:20 - James Kemp: Completely off topic - do we want to up beer order quantity?
03/07/2022, 13:20 - James Kemp: Currently at 4 cans each a day
03/07/2022, 13:21 - +44 7462 872590: üëÄ could do more
03/07/2022, 13:21 - +44 7462 872590: We can always top up supplies when we are there
03/07/2022, 13:21 - +44 7752 359588: So about the groceries
03/07/2022, 13:22 - +44 7752 359588: We can only order 135 individual items
03/07/2022, 13:22 - +44 7752 359588: So I've had to rejig some stuff around
03/07/2022, 13:22 - James Kemp: Ah okay - thanks for sorting!
03/07/2022, 13:22 - +44 7752 359588: So inevitably we'll need to take a trip to the big shops at some point
03/07/2022, 13:23 - +44 7752 359588: They look fairly close?
03/07/2022, 13:23 - James Kemp: I trust your judgement - can just do an in person run to top up?
03/07/2022, 13:23 - +44 7752 359588: So yeah I've had to cut some of the initial beverages
03/07/2022, 13:23 - +44 7462 872590: üëçüëç
03/07/2022, 13:23 - +44 7752 359588: (also thinking about fridge space)
03/07/2022, 13:23 - +44 7462 872590: True, there might be two fridges... But don't hold me to that
03/07/2022, 13:33 - +44 7752 359588: Oh my god, my greatest fantasy
03/07/2022, 13:33 - +44 7752 359588: Give me a chest freezer and I'm never leaving
03/07/2022, 13:34 - +44 7752 359588: Indeed! There's a bunch of big ones in the next big town over, so not too much of a schlep I think
03/07/2022, 13:38 - Sam Lea: Big ol' Tesco is a 10 min drive away
03/07/2022, 13:38 - James Kemp: Thanks again for sorting @447752359588!
03/07/2022, 13:39 - Sam Lea: Have these 4 been divvied up yet? If so, I'd like to be tennis gyal from the optionals
03/07/2022, 13:39 - James Kemp: I think the only mandatory left to assign is the baker
03/07/2022, 13:40 - James Kemp: Happy to take her if she doesn‚Äôt end up getting picked
03/07/2022, 13:40 - James Kemp: So yes, live your tennis gyal fantasy!
03/07/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúYou live your whole life as if you were overacting in a play‚Äù is actually a great vibe
03/07/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: So I‚Äôm down with being a baked baker bitch
03/07/2022, 13:53 - James Kemp: @447912940213 if 2Cb isn‚Äôt available (annoyingly, it‚Äôs not on the news menu), whaddya think? Just go without or get something else?
03/07/2022, 13:56 - Aaron Ayling: Maybe ket?
03/07/2022, 13:56 - James Kemp: Yeah that‚Äôs what we were thinking
03/07/2022, 13:57 - Aaron Ayling: üê¥ üíâ

03/07/2022, 14:08 - Sam Lea: Yep, no 2CB on his menu unfortunately
03/07/2022, 14:08 - James Kemp: Boooooooo

03/07/2022, 14:24 - Reuben Yarwood: I think trainers would be fine but Ella disagrees. If it's raining hiking shoes would be better

03/07/2022, 15:46 - +44 7462 872590: So there is a "secret" infinity pool on Snowdon that we could seek out
03/07/2022, 15:47 - +44 7462 872590: https://www.thewalkingnortherners.co.uk/snowdonia-secret-infinity-pool-location/
03/07/2022, 15:52 - +44 7462 872590: A good day out would be to go to Anglesey, an hours drive. Newborough Forest is meant to be very nice. Where the forest meets the beach.
03/07/2022, 15:54 - Aaron Ayling: Sounds lovely!

I'd vote for just aiming to get to the top of Snowden rather than trying to find secret places and end up breaking a leg.
03/07/2022, 15:54 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha, true
03/07/2022, 15:55 - +44 7462 872590: If y'all want to do a castle, Beaumaris Castle and Caernarfon Castle are both under an hour away

03/07/2022, 18:51 - Edward Beesley: What was the latest on duvets/sheets? I know A+L are bringing a duvet and some sheets, and george a duvet? Shall I also bring a duvet?
03/07/2022, 18:53 - +44 7462 872590: Your car only needs to bring up one duvet.
03/07/2022, 18:57 - +44 7462 872590: This

03/07/2022, 21:01 - Aaron Ayling: Just takeaway or summit
03/07/2022, 21:01 - Aaron Ayling: Maybe BBQ if there is one and the weather is nice (and there is a place to buy meat nearby)?
03/07/2022, 21:04 - +44 7462 872590: üëç there's a big Tesco 10 mins away

07/07/2022, 12:08 - Reuben Yarwood: Do you guys have any change? I think the car park we're going to is cash only. I have cash so we'll look for somewhere to change it. Otherwise think there is a caff near Pen y Pass car park?

12/07/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: We definitely had a lil md/coke skank to Smoko??
12/07/2022, 13:41 - James Kemp: Maybe to this guy? https://youtu.be/DJsn1QivbKM
12/07/2022, 13:54 - Aaron Ayling: Haha works so well to The Sopranos theme.

12/07/2022, 15:40 - James Kemp: Willing to take that hit
12/07/2022, 15:41 - +44 7752 359588: Oh don't be ridiculous, please put it back on
12/07/2022, 15:42 - James Kemp: ü§°
12/07/2022, 15:45 - +44 7752 359588: I suspect we're missing some gas money from both Ed and Sam, and also sam's car things?
12/07/2022, 15:45 - +44 7462 872590: I'm getting a Monzo account that should be activated in the next few days, if it's easier to just add me to the tab.
12/07/2022, 15:48 - +44 7752 359588: Ahaha George did this holiday make you finally submit to peer pressure
12/07/2022, 15:49 - Aaron Ayling: The man finally got to George.
12/07/2022, 15:49 - Aaron Ayling: He's on the grid
12/07/2022, 15:50 - +44 7462 872590: Hahaha, only the 7 years late
13/07/2022, 09:13 - +44 7462 872590: Hey, Nock just wanted me to pass on his thanks for leaving the place in such good shape. Cheers!

13/07/2022, 16:24 - James Kemp: (@Daisy Jones, go fuck yourself üòä)
13/07/2022, 16:25 - James Kemp: Nice to see Helen‚Äôs legacy for quality Vice journalism is continuing
13/07/2022, 16:26 - +44 7752 359588: It feels very buzzfeed-esque doesn't it

14/07/2022, 13:06 - Sam Lea: What are people thinking in terms of Sunday, if not the Country Fayre?
14/07/2022, 13:07 - Sam Lea: If we're worried about overheating, bear in mind we're a 3 min walk from the park with a couple of big strong fans, a load of ice in the freezer and a living room for a bit of chillin'
14/07/2022, 13:08 - Sam Lea: Alternatively, if we just aren't feeling the Fayre altogether, would a shady beer garden somewhere followed (or not) by a mini, dainty, gentle sesh of sorts (beers and YouTube at the very least, if desired) be a possible scenario?
14/07/2022, 13:09 - Sam Lea: *at ours
14/07/2022, 13:10 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh I'd be down for any variation of the above
14/07/2022, 13:10 - +44 7752 359588: I do now have the Welsh cold, but hoping I'll feel better by Sunday

14/07/2022, 13:11 - Sam Lea: She'll get ya like that...
14/07/2022, 13:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Looks like the temperature could be a little lower than expected
14/07/2022, 13:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Mine only lasted a couple of days so fingers crossed!
14/07/2022, 13:43 - +44 7752 359588: I'd be willing to risk it for a biscuit if we can retreat to fans and shade!
14/07/2022, 13:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Sounds like a plan!
14/07/2022, 14:01 - +44 7462 872590: üëçüòéüëç
14/07/2022, 14:07 - James Kemp: I will let you know on Sunday itself, if that‚Äôs alright!! Got a bottomless brunch the day before, so hard to judge what my vibe‚Äôs gonna be, but theoretically down for any/all o dis!!
14/07/2022, 16:04 - Aaron Ayling: You joke but Liz genuinely wanted this yesterday
14/07/2022, 16:05 - Aaron Ayling: And also can cool off for 20 mins after trekking down there haha

15/07/2022, 09:01 - +44 7752 359588: Omg this is amazing
15/07/2022, 09:01 - +61 474 759 280: LOL 6 years on
15/07/2022, 09:01 - +61 474 759 280: Nice
15/07/2022, 09:01 - +44 7752 359588: The future liberals warned you about
15/07/2022, 09:05 - +44 7462 872590: "internet memes can be great fun"
15/07/2022, 09:06 - +44 7462 872590: I guess people have been using it at work
15/07/2022, 09:10 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah probably just pops up on the tenor suggested now and then and peeps using pepes without knowing the potential connotations
15/07/2022, 09:11 - +61 474 759 280: TiVo was a pro Trump company so many not unknowingly?
15/07/2022, 09:12 - Aaron Ayling: I knew Trump was pro TiVo, didn't know it was the other way around too
15/07/2022, 09:12 - +61 474 759 280: That‚Äôs just me smearing
15/07/2022, 09:12 - Aaron Ayling: I thought they tried to like Harold smile and politely dissasociatefrom him
15/07/2022, 09:12 - +44 7462 872590: Hey, whatever shifts units. Business is business
15/07/2022, 09:12 - Aaron Ayling: Ah right
15/07/2022, 12:40 - Aaron Ayling: 41 degrees on Tuesday fuck me
15/07/2022, 12:41 - Reuben Yarwood: Just keeps creeping up
15/07/2022, 12:41 - Reuben Yarwood: Wish me luck on that ride home!
15/07/2022, 12:41 - James Kemp: 41?!
15/07/2022, 12:41 - James Kemp: End of days

15/07/2022, 12:48 - Aaron Ayling: I've started ice farming, I've got my trays on a steady rotation
15/07/2022, 13:35 - +61 474 759 280: How are your homes holding up?
15/07/2022, 13:36 - +61 474 759 280: Can‚Äôt be worse than our place on Richmond Road or Green Lanes
15/07/2022, 13:38 - Aaron Ayling: We're okay if we adopt a proactive policy of opening all the windows and doors at night and trapping that cool air, then shutting all the windows and all the blinds on the sunny side for the rest of the day
15/07/2022, 13:39 - Aaron Ayling: But if you let that sun and hot air in past 2pm we are fucked in the evening
15/07/2022, 17:02 - +44 7462 872590: Okay team, my Monzo is up and running if you wanna add me to the tab
15/07/2022, 17:37 - Aaron Ayling: Cool, looks like monzo is annoying and wont calculate what you owe automatically as we added the bills before you joined.

Looks like if one contributed nothing so far one would owe about ¬£135. I'll add a custom bill of ¬£100 for you - a bit less as you paid cash for the Chinese, we're now splitting it 6 ways instead of 7 and you did way way way more cleaning and tidying that the rest of us x
15/07/2022, 17:41 - Aaron Ayling: Actually this won't settle it either as it'll make no dent in what the others owe... Genuinely think that it may be easier if we say you just owe ¬£20 to everyone (except me) - that'll be ¬£100 total!
15/07/2022, 18:12 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
15/07/2022, 19:17 - Reuben Yarwood: G, better to split my 20 between Aaron Liz Ed and Sam as they paid for the bulk of stuff. And maybe Jim's? So just 30 each to those four?
15/07/2022, 19:18 - Reuben Yarwood: Although I guess we're squaring up on Monzo first so ignore me

15/07/2022, 19:24 - +44 7752 359588: I think @447595390314 and @447940330084 still have gas and other car bits to add???
15/07/2022, 19:24 - +44 7752 359588: Don't be shy lads
15/07/2022, 19:43 - Sam Lea: Yep, will get on this asap
15/07/2022, 19:45 - Aaron Ayling: @447595390314 @447940330084 if you split your bill 7 ways when adding it then George can pay you for his share of the petrol/car bits.

For the bills up to this point I reckon George just trannies erry1 that isn't me ¬£20 and that should square up!
15/07/2022, 20:19 - Edward Beesley: Yep, I've got a couple of petrol fill ups and car insurance to add. All paid with other cards than Monzo though, but I can add it as a custom bill though aye?
15/07/2022, 20:21 - +44 7752 359588: You should be able to!
15/07/2022, 20:40 - Edward Beesley: Cool, all added. BTW, I'm up in Macc this weekend so won't be in attendance for any of the weekend's sweatty shenanigans!

04/08/2022, 09:25 - +61 474 759 280: In a surprise development, he claimed that Mr Jones's legal team had since "messed up" and accidentally sent the plaintiffs' legal team a file containing trial strategy notes and two years of text messages.

The parents' lawyers also had emails obtained from other sources.

Mr Bankston showed the court an email from an InfoWars business officer, informing Mr Jones that the company had earned more than $1.15 million gross in selling its products in a single day, which would amount to nearly $430 million in a year. Mr Jones said that was the company's best day in sales.
04/08/2022, 09:26 - +44 7462 872590: Yeah, saw that. The whole thing is insane. Do you reckon his lawyers did it on purpose?
04/08/2022, 09:28 - +61 474 759 280: You kind of hope so for their sake
04/08/2022, 09:31 - +44 7462 872590: Will that be his next conspiracy theory... Or will he hopefully not be able to do anything anymore.

04/08/2022, 09:46 - +44 7752 359588: But also apparently the lawyers could have contested that it shouldn't have been allowed in court and they just didn't
04/08/2022, 09:46 - +44 7752 359588: Which feels like a major fuck up
04/08/2022, 09:56 - +61 474 759 280: The prosecutor must have thought they were having a fever dream

10/08/2022, 03:23 - +44 7752 359588: A mockumentary about ABBA's Australias tour
10/08/2022, 03:40 - +61 474 759 280: Nice
10/08/2022, 03:42 - +44 7752 359588: Features some peak 1970s OZ
10/08/2022, 03:42 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs always weird seeing films set in Australia pre-1980s, I know everyone thinks our accent‚Äôs messed up but I think we used to be much stranger
10/08/2022, 03:43 - +44 7752 359588: I weirdly find everyone intelligible? But this movie was also made by swedes which probably helps
10/08/2022, 03:43 - +61 474 759 280: Well, maybe we‚Äôve regressed
10/08/2022, 03:44 - +44 7752 359588: Couple weird deep cuts in this movie too, which I imagine were bigger at the time
10/08/2022, 03:44 - +61 474 759 280: At any rate I think we definitely sound different. Ow

11/08/2022, 13:57 - James Kemp: Even on night 1 when he ate what I cooked
11/08/2022, 13:57 - James Kemp: He complained the whole time that he wanted meat
11/08/2022, 13:57 - James Kemp: Like girl stfu and eat what you‚Äôre given
11/08/2022, 13:57 - +44 7752 359588: Also, I feel awful for Dani - all that work to get him over and now he's going back to Argentina
11/08/2022, 13:57 - James Kemp: Yeah he‚Äôs pretty done as well
11/08/2022, 13:58 - James Kemp: But it‚Äôs not all as bleak as it sounds - he‚Äôs fucking annoying but we‚Äôre good!!

18/08/2022, 19:34 - +44 7752 359588: His entire rating system of edibles was "this will fuck you up" and "this will definitely fuck you up" and "this won't fuck you up"
18/08/2022, 19:34 - Aaron Ayling: Haha love it
18/08/2022, 19:34 - Aaron Ayling: Thanks for getting shit!

18/08/2022, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: And my mom also had to use her allotment for my dad
18/08/2022, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: I think I did!
18/08/2022, 19:37 - +44 7752 359588: I panicked

19/08/2022, 14:54 - James Kemp: Arbeit macht BYE

19/08/2022, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: I'll let Aaron comment on that - I bought my one container of sleeping pills, but he's swimming in da kush
19/08/2022, 15:05 - +61 474 759 280: This photo definitely captures some of that 2016 spirit

19/08/2022, 15:58 - Aaron Ayling: That's awesome!

19/08/2022, 15:58 - Aaron Ayling: Policy in the UK is super competitive, so that's doubly impressive if that's the case in the UK
19/08/2022, 15:59 - Aaron Ayling: Aus*
19/08/2022, 15:59 - James Kemp: We don‚Äôt do unnecessary self deprecation, John! Obviously not a fluke! Slay!

22/08/2022, 15:40 - Reuben Yarwood: Yes! Don't know which one is better
22/08/2022, 15:41 - Reuben Yarwood: It was a very sweet ceremony too. Glad I shoehorned myself into an invite
22/08/2022, 15:42 - Aaron Ayling: I feel like partner of the best person isn't really shoehorning yourself in!
22/08/2022, 15:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah it seems reasonable she'd get a plus one, but I deffo wasn't on the guestlist initially.
22/08/2022, 16:05 - +44 7752 359588: Awww good! This looks like such a blast!
22/08/2022, 16:05 - +44 7752 359588: A Sunday wedding too - bold! I guess because Saturday is the sabbath?
22/08/2022, 16:05 - +44 7752 359588: This is a delight

22/08/2022, 19:01 - Reuben Yarwood: It was upstairs in the Trafalgar Tavern in Greenwich, which is why the walls are plastered in nautical scenes/navy guys
22/08/2022, 19:01 - Reuben Yarwood: Was overlooking the Thames
22/08/2022, 19:18 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh yeah was wondering what the water was

23/08/2022, 13:59 - +44 7752 359588: I think she saw it as a joke on Family Guy?

24/08/2022, 09:09 - +61 474 759 280: Thank you for this reminder, I was actually going to look into exactly that

24/08/2022, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm unsure whether to get into it or not. Think it's the most expensive series ever made? Or maybe that's the new GOT one
24/08/2022, 12:37 - Reuben Yarwood: Feel like I could get into both but don't want to watch all that TV really.
24/08/2022, 12:38 - Reuben Yarwood: What news from the New World Liz? How are the road trip plans going?

24/08/2022, 12:40 - +44 7752 359588: Road trip has morphed into potential trip around Arizona and Utah, as Aaron's back isn't doing so hot in cars/ I am extremely burnt out on planning things, but I'm very excited by that! We might get to stay in the grand canyon park!
24/08/2022, 12:40 - Aaron Ayling: See if you can pass reubs.

18/10/2022, 07:24 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôve very much enjoyed reading the courteous reviews from my AirBnB hosts after I‚Äôve served them in their accommodation reviews for their various shortcomings
18/10/2022, 07:25 - +61 474 759 280: My pet peeve is hosts who leave passive aggressive notes in the kitchen and bathroom reminding you to clean up after yourself.

18/10/2022, 12:40 - +44 7462 872590: He's still the most popular amongst the base by a long way.... That's how bad the rest of them are
18/10/2022, 14:26 - Aaron Ayling: I don't think so, it'd kill them dead. People were pissed off about partygate (which primed them to then be real fucking mad about the mini budget), I think if you go back to Boris you show everyone you're out of ideas, and his charm without substance won't cut it anymore.

21/10/2022, 14:35 - +44 7752 359588: This genuinely feels like a joke
21/10/2022, 14:35 - James Kemp: Yep - she marketed it as 70s and it‚Äôs just the same old crap
21/10/2022, 14:36 - James Kemp: No idea why the marketing and the product are so different but I‚Äôm mad
21/10/2022, 14:36 - +44 7752 359588: Surely the public can't take Boris back??? Is everyone's memory like 3 weeks long??
21/10/2022, 14:36 - +44 7752 359588: Oh hadn't seen any of the marketing for it
21/10/2022, 14:37 - James Kemp: Mate the public are cunts and the stories dgaf
21/10/2022, 14:37 - James Kemp: I honestly think it might happen
21/10/2022, 14:37 - James Kemp: *Tories
21/10/2022, 14:38 - Aaron Ayling: The thinking among MPs is he at least won the last election so you can argue he has a mandate?
21/10/2022, 14:38 - +44 7752 359588: Just when you think it can't get stupider, it gets more stupider
21/10/2022, 14:38 - James Kemp: Every damn time!!
21/10/2022, 14:38 - Aaron Ayling: Thing is that privileges committee is giving their verdict on partygate in like 4 weeks and it's looking bad for Boris
21/10/2022, 14:39 - +61 474 759 280: Build back Boris better
21/10/2022, 14:39 - James Kemp: Did you see GE predictions if it were to happen?
21/10/2022, 14:39 - James Kemp: Labour on like 477 seats
21/10/2022, 14:39 - James Kemp: Tories on like 74?
21/10/2022, 14:39 - Aaron Ayling: Yes it's delightful
21/10/2022, 14:40 - +44 7752 359588: It seems crazy that a party can be so unpopular, but they get to call the next election, so they're just going to keep their claws in power
21/10/2022, 14:40 - James Kemp: They changed the rules themselves back in what - 2019?
21/10/2022, 14:40 - James Kemp: Parliament used to have the right to call an election by a majority vote?
21/10/2022, 14:40 - James Kemp: Now it‚Äôs back with PM unless they call VonC??
21/10/2022, 14:41 - Aaron Ayling: Well same would happen in the US right? You're locked in every 4 years?
21/10/2022, 14:41 - James Kemp: On the brighter side, I just had my filling done and it didn‚Äôt hurt and now I don‚Äôt need to go back to the dentist for another 20 years woooooooooo
21/10/2022, 14:41 - Aaron Ayling: Or could congress/the senate force one?
21/10/2022, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: Oh no, it's very regular
21/10/2022, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: But my point is that we know we have elections every two years
21/10/2022, 14:50 - +44 7752 359588: You couldn't force one earlier because you're doing well either
21/10/2022, 14:51 - +44 7752 359588: Also every 2 years (staggered, so everyone has a 4-6 year term) is a lot less than every 5
22/10/2022, 11:51 - +44 7462 872590: <Media omitted>
22/10/2022, 15:05 - Aaron Ayling: It's going to be fucking Boris isn't it
22/10/2022, 15:06 - Aaron Ayling: I mean probably best case scenario for Labour (barring immediate election) but its just such an awful thought
22/10/2022, 15:58 - Sam Lea: Only hope is this is released and does them even more damage
22/10/2022, 21:08 - +61 474 759 280: Boris uncancelled
23/10/2022, 22:22 - +44 7752 359588: Bojo has cancelled himself
23/10/2022, 22:22 - +44 7752 359588: I wonder what kind of behind the scenes fuckery happened there
23/10/2022, 22:22 - +44 7752 359588: Looks like dishy Rishi is moving into number 10
23/10/2022, 22:23 - James Kemp: Yes thank fuck for that

25/10/2022, 17:22 - Aaron Ayling: You'd think Rishi would want to ride the wave of popularity he's getting in India right now, and not put back in the person who pissed them off so much they withdrew from the trade deal they were ready to sign haha

25/10/2022, 23:23 - +61 474 759 280: I‚Äôm in the office today. Because I‚Äôm the newbie I feel cucked into following management‚Äôs request to come in three days a week. The rest of the team is barely making it in one day a week and I love that

26/10/2022, 04:01 - +61 474 759 280: I could see him resigning in about a year
26/10/2022, 04:03 - Aaron Ayling: If he gets through privileges committee report about partygate then I think hell get to a GE which will be as far away as it can be
26/10/2022, 04:09 - +61 474 759 280: I just get the feeling he‚Äôs a bit too soft to stick it out? He had a sook when his wife was called out for not paying tax, which felt like a pretty pedestrian criticism at the time
26/10/2022, 04:10 - +61 474 759 280: And the crazies in the Conservative party hate him, and you need them surely
26/10/2022, 09:29 - James Kemp: I find Rashood Sanook impossible to watch in speeches - it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs an upload from Meta, talks like a stilted algorithm üôà

14/11/2022, 12:09 - +44 7752 359588: I bet the cat bus is terrifying

18/11/2022, 14:47 - James Kemp: LOL
18/11/2022, 14:48 - James Kemp: Also like it‚Äôs a problem that needs verifying
18/11/2022, 14:48 - James Kemp: ‚ÄúMight need to check the footage and see if they really hate fags‚Äù
18/11/2022, 15:41 - Sam Lea: What do we think the chances are of Twitter fully, properly stopping?
18/11/2022, 15:43 - Aaron Ayling: Very low
18/11/2022, 15:43 - Aaron Ayling: There's nothing to replace it

19/11/2022, 11:33 - Sam Lea: oh dear
19/11/2022, 11:33 - +44 7462 872590: Infantino opened by saying: "Today I have strong feelings. Today I feel Qatari, I feel Arab, I feel African, I feel gay, I feel disabled, I feel a migrant worker."
19/11/2022, 11:33 - Sam Lea: oh very dear

19/11/2022, 13:55 - +44 7752 359588: I wanna be on whatever he's on

20/11/2022, 17:00 - +44 7752 359588: There were a lot of old Korean people cheering us on as race Marshalls, which is a vibe I like

20/11/2022, 17:10 - +44 7462 872590: That medal looks amazing

20/11/2022, 17:21 - +44 7752 359588: There were people in actual turkey outfits running the 5k
20/11/2022, 18:49 - Reuben Yarwood: Well done! I have never seen someone looking this fresh after 10k!
20/11/2022, 20:04 - +44 7752 359588: Turns out you don't get thaaaat sweaty when it's -9

22/11/2022, 12:11 - Reuben Yarwood: Just having a chat with Ella about boycotting the World Cup. What does everyone think about it?
22/11/2022, 12:12 - Reuben Yarwood: I imagine personally I'll do what I always do and watch a few of the England games but otherwise not really engage.
22/11/2022, 12:12 - Reuben Yarwood: Here's a Stonewall online campaign to sign up to though
22/11/2022, 12:12 - Reuben Yarwood: https://www.stonewall.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/stand-lgbtq-people-qatar-proud-stadium
22/11/2022, 12:13 - Reuben Yarwood: My Dad is refusing to watch any games
22/11/2022, 12:13 - Sam Lea: A few online peeps I know have done a sweepstake with the dosh going to that Stonewall campaign, which I've chipped into
22/11/2022, 12:13 - Reuben Yarwood: That's a nice idea!
22/11/2022, 12:25 - +61 474 759 280: I decided I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it so sitting this one out. Not so much as a boycott, I just think I‚Äôd feel gross watching it
22/11/2022, 12:28 - James Kemp: Idgaf about football unless I‚Äôm watching it with you lot so not really a tough decision for me üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
22/11/2022, 12:49 - +44 7462 872590: I am watching, but yeah feel gross about it
22/11/2022, 12:50 - +44 7462 872590: Good idea
22/11/2022, 12:51 - +44 7462 872590: Especially after teams backed down for wearing the one love rainbow armbands
22/11/2022, 12:52 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah they 100% should have worn them
22/11/2022, 12:52 - James Kemp: Wasn‚Äôt it a blanket yellow card if they did?
22/11/2022, 12:53 - James Kemp: Feel like, again, it‚Äôs the FA who are the villains here
22/11/2022, 12:53 - +44 7462 872590: Yep, FIFA are the dicks
22/11/2022, 12:53 - Reuben Yarwood: If every team did it they'd be on a level playing field
22/11/2022, 12:53 - James Kemp: But every team won‚Äôt
22/11/2022, 12:53 - Reuben Yarwood: But also what was the justification for the yellow card?
22/11/2022, 12:54 - James Kemp: It‚Äôs stupid that it‚Äôs being put on players
22/11/2022, 12:54 - +44 7462 872590: Political symbols are banned by FIFA
22/11/2022, 12:55 - +44 7462 872590: I think they still should. Let them book Harry Kane in front of the world then have to explain why
22/11/2022, 13:59 - +44 7752 359588: I'm on the Johnny Stowellman side of things - beyond the blatant homophobia, the slave labor and deaths that went into making this world cup are just too much for me
22/11/2022, 13:59 - +44 7752 359588: It's definitely on fifa as much as qatar
22/11/2022, 14:00 - +44 7752 359588: That being said, I'm still a filthy sellout, because the next world cup is the north American one and I want tickets
22/11/2022, 14:05 - +44 7752 359588: In better world event news, Eurovision is doing away with jury voting for the semi finals AND there's going to be an aggregate global vote for all non-participating countries!
22/11/2022, 14:07 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh nice!
22/11/2022, 15:27 - James Kemp: Omg WAT
22/11/2022, 15:27 - James Kemp: This feels like a game changer!
22/11/2022, 15:27 - James Kemp: The whole world voting?!
22/11/2022, 15:28 - +44 7752 359588: I mean the whole rest of the world is only gonna count as one country
22/11/2022, 15:28 - James Kemp: What‚Äôs behind these changes, O resident Eurovision expert??
22/11/2022, 15:28 - +44 7752 359588: But I am here for it!
22/11/2022, 15:29 - +44 7752 359588: I haven't read too much into it (maybe @447595390314 knows) but I suspect it has to do with all the jury tomfoolery and collusion that was bandied about last year
22/11/2022, 15:29 - James Kemp: Imagine vote reveal portion is now a day long as we painstakingly watch Kazakhstani Nigella glitch her way through why she‚Äôs given the UK zero points
22/11/2022, 15:29 - James Kemp: Followed by every other country on the planet
22/11/2022, 15:30 - +44 7752 359588: I would have loved it
22/11/2022, 15:30 - James Kemp: Also I imagine there‚Äôs more ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£ in letting everyone partake??
22/11/2022, 15:30 - +44 7752 359588: Oh also! Someone has gone back and looked at previous years votes, and apparently if they had done away with the jury before Fage, Fage Natural Greek Yogurt would have made it to the finals
22/11/2022, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: Possibly! I'm not sure if it's going to be an online thing or a phone thing
22/11/2022, 15:31 - +44 7752 359588: Also juries still get to weigh in in the finals
22/11/2022, 15:32 - James Kemp: Personally can‚Äôt wait for our virtual Eurovision next year
22/11/2022, 15:32 - +44 7752 359588: Yesssss
22/11/2022, 15:32 - James Kemp: Itself set to become a global event!
24/11/2022, 10:43 - Reuben Yarwood: Sorry to lower the tone. But anyone seen the video of the Dad of the club Q shooter? Absolutely chilling
24/11/2022, 16:18 - +44 7752 359588: It's so disturbing. Also apparently he was a porn star? Some weird shit happening there
24/11/2022, 17:12 - Reuben Yarwood: A very worrying fella
24/11/2022, 22:52 - +61 474 759 280: On top of it just being broadcasted hate, the guy was obviously tweaking. I can‚Äôt believe it went to air
25/11/2022, 00:03 - James Kemp: <Media omitted>
25/11/2022, 00:05 - +61 474 759 280: Lol I haven‚Äôt seen this one in a while
25/11/2022, 00:06 - James Kemp: I like how many of us feature
25/11/2022, 00:06 - James Kemp: Who‚Äôs that bitch tho
25/11/2022, 00:06 - James Kemp: ?
25/11/2022, 00:07 - +61 474 759 280: Str8 Nasty suffered a net financial loss of about ¬£100 from you per night on account of you just stealing beers with gay abandon for everyone
25/11/2022, 00:08 - James Kemp: üòä
25/11/2022, 00:08 - +61 474 759 280: Money lost all meaning
25/11/2022, 00:08 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd do it again
25/11/2022, 00:08 - James Kemp: Remember their FB inbox message asking me if our engagement was real
25/11/2022, 00:08 - James Kemp: They wanted to post it on their socials
25/11/2022, 00:08 - +61 474 759 280: Hahahahhaha
25/11/2022, 00:09 - James Kemp: Had to reply that ‚Äúit was complicated‚Äù with a request not to post
25/11/2022, 00:09 - +61 474 759 280: LOL
25/11/2022, 00:09 - James Kemp: üôÉ

25/11/2022, 00:09 - +61 474 759 280: well that‚Äôs the difference between Stowellman from beginning and end of London years
25/11/2022, 00:11 - +61 474 759 280: I feel like by 2020 I would have accepted whatever came of it, announce to my Facebook community I‚Äôm engaged for the ruse
25/11/2022, 00:11 - James Kemp: Especially to a twink like this
25/11/2022, 00:12 - James Kemp: Your followers would‚Äôve doubled overnight
25/11/2022, 00:12 - James Kemp: üòè

28/11/2022, 22:37 - Sam Lea: that is a _densely_ decorated tree üåü
28/11/2022, 22:47 - +61 474 759 280: The tree and poinsettias in Chicago is giving Home Alone realness
28/11/2022, 22:48 - +44 7752 359588: Not pictured: the 10 strings of dead lights we pulled off of the tree before putting it up
28/11/2022, 22:48 - +44 7752 359588: Whenever a strand burned out, my mom would just chuck another on over it

28/11/2022, 22:51 - +61 474 759 280: Is it a Chicago thing?
28/11/2022, 22:52 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think so? Maybe American?
28/11/2022, 22:52 - +44 7752 359588: I think poinsettias are just a thing
29/11/2022, 11:31 - James Kemp: Can confirm: my dad used to buy my mum one every Christmas until, a decade later, she finally confirmed she hates them
29/11/2022, 11:31 - James Kemp: ü•¥
29/11/2022, 11:32 - James Kemp: Also looking Christmas card ready! So good!
29/11/2022, 14:30 - +44 7462 872590: What is the plan for the USA trip next year? How long is everyone planning on going over for? (I'm just looking to book some holidays for next year and seeing how many days I can use)
29/11/2022, 14:37 - Aaron Ayling: We're gonna send official save the dates out this week

Party is set for Saturday 16th September (and we'll do something on the Friday before too) but I would say tacking an extra week on afterwards for us to all do fun stuff. I'd like to get a cabin or something but will need to sort that out/look at budgets.

Basically we'll have to deal with family and shit at the actual reception so want some time in after to enjoy the US with y'all
29/11/2022, 14:40 - +44 7462 872590: üëç
29/11/2022, 15:33 - James Kemp: Is it maybe worth us agreeing group travel dates?
29/11/2022, 15:33 - James Kemp: Fly out on 14th September, return on 22nd was maybe what I was gonna do
29/11/2022, 15:34 - James Kemp: Arrive a day in advance of first engagement on the Fri, back with a full weekend to recover?
29/11/2022, 15:34 - James Kemp: (8 night stay)
29/11/2022, 15:34 - James Kemp: Just a first stab tho, so others input!!
29/11/2022, 15:41 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah I mean obviously it's whatever works with all of your schedules/budgets etc! It would be great to be able to cabin it up for a bit after, and also I hope you get a chance to see a bit of the city (which can easily be done in 2-3 days depending on vibes)! I'm hoping to take a few days to show people around, if they want it!
29/11/2022, 15:41 - Reuben Yarwood: I would love to have the Liz tour of Chicago!
29/11/2022, 15:42 - James Kemp: Fuck yeah!

30/11/2022, 15:39 - +44 7752 359588: Knowles family dominating

30/11/2022, 18:57 - +44 7752 359588: I have not been watching, what's the t?
30/11/2022, 19:07 - Sam Lea: Oh just for Snatch Game, she strong-armed one of the contestants (who was going to do Enya) into doing just some generic, slightly offensive Irish charicature instead...
30/11/2022, 19:08 - +44 7752 359588: Oh nooooo
30/11/2022, 19:08 - +44 7752 359588: Enya would be a great shout too

01/12/2022, 12:32 - Aaron Ayling: But clefairy was gonna be the mascot before pikachu tested better
01/12/2022, 12:33 - +61 474 759 280: I wonder how different the world would have been
01/12/2022, 12:34 - +61 474 759 280: Under a Clefairy hegemon
01/12/2022, 12:35 - +61 474 759 280: Funny to think how much they downweighted Clefairy after that
01/12/2022, 12:35 - +61 474 759 280: Like not even in the top 20 most prominent I‚Äôd say
01/12/2022, 12:36 - +61 474 759 280: Must have TANKED testing
01/12/2022, 12:41 - Aaron Ayling: I think jigglypuff is a more interesting "designed to be cute" one too
01/12/2022, 12:41 - Aaron Ayling: Fills the niche

01/12/2022, 13:13 - James Kemp: I think the anime made me a Jiggly stan
01/12/2022, 13:13 - James Kemp: She‚Äôs such a fucking stresshead vibe
01/12/2022, 13:14 - James Kemp: Aggressively demanding everyone get on her level whilst simultaneously KOing them all
01/12/2022, 13:16 - Aaron Ayling: I think the anime (and smash bros) is the only reason jigglypuff is still present today, don't think she'd make the cut otherwise. Great pkmn
01/12/2022, 13:16 - James Kemp: PUFF!

05/12/2022, 20:41 - Aaron Ayling: What is it?!
05/12/2022, 20:44 - Reuben Yarwood: Not much actually Macclesfield featured so far

05/12/2022, 22:17 - +44 7752 359588: Somehow I'm not sure this one would have paired nearly as well with ket

I am too far away from home ‚Ä¶ I am a beautiful black woman and I am not going to get in front of some audience of white people for them to be throwing shit at me. I am so not sorry.

15/12/2022, 20:29 - +44 7462 872590: Germany - Spain?
15/12/2022, 20:30 - +61 474 759 280: Somehow I find that more appealing
15/12/2022, 20:31 - James Kemp: I feel like it‚Äôs a pretty good villain showdown

15/12/2022, 20:32 - +44 7462 872590: I dunno. At least there is the interest of can Messi win the world cup. Germany/Spain don't have any superstars at the moment and play pretty bland football.

15/12/2022, 20:46 - +44 7752 359588: BUT the most interesting part is that my role is funded entirely by a grant from the JPB foundation, which was endowed by Jeffry Picower, aka the largest beneficiary of Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme
15/12/2022, 20:46 - +44 7752 359588: So basically that dirty Madoff money is paying for my new job

15/12/2022, 20:48 - +44 7752 359588: (I am also happy about this job, it sounds cool, but I am loling over the funding, especially given that the whole point is civil justice and poverty alleviation)

04/01/2023, 15:53 - +44 7752 359588: I just have no desire to awkwardly wander around looking for people to talk to
04/01/2023, 15:53 - +44 7752 359588: This office is also weirdly big and empty, so you have to actually look for people

04/01/2023, 20:44 - +61 474 759 280: Looking swish Liz!
04/01/2023, 21:24 - +44 7752 359588: Forgot that martin Luther king day and presidents day are things here
04/01/2023, 21:24 - +44 7752 359588: Thrilled to have a couple bank holidays coming up so soon

06/01/2023, 16:51 - +44 7752 359588: What were some of your face albums of 2022, new or otherwise? Looking for some things to listen to as a slog through some boring admin shit
06/01/2023, 16:57 - Reuben Yarwood: I haven't got into any albums recently but enjoyed this online radio show last year:
https://www.nts.live/shows/the-breakfast-show-zakia
06/01/2023, 17:06 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh gonna give it a listen now!
06/01/2023, 17:28 - +44 7752 359588: Love her vibe
06/01/2023, 17:28 - +44 7752 359588: Very eclectic
06/01/2023, 17:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah and a bit pagan/witchy sometimes
06/01/2023, 17:34 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah! I'm listening to the show from this day last year and she had covid, so it's all "healing sounds"
06/01/2023, 17:35 - Sam Lea: Was she the DJ we saw at that Midsummer British Museum event?
06/01/2023, 17:35 - Reuben Yarwood: She was
07/01/2023, 14:49 - Reuben Yarwood: @447752359588 how were your first few days?
09/01/2023, 15:46 - +44 7752 359588: So far so good! Plenty of random admin stuff for me to get into, so not totally twiddling my thumbs anymore
09/01/2023, 15:46 - +44 7752 359588: I am, however, the only person in the office today, I'm pretty sure
09/01/2023, 15:46 - +44 7752 359588: Party time
09/01/2023, 16:01 - +44 7752 359588: ALSO FRIENDS - WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT EUROVISION
09/01/2023, 16:01 - +44 7752 359588: We're quite keen to make it out if we can, and tix are supposed to go on sale sometime this month, so I wanna know what the game plan is
09/01/2023, 16:02 - Aaron Ayling: Strong strong preference for seeing a jury show or semi in person, then watching the final on TV from us btw
09/01/2023, 16:02 - +44 7752 359588: My personal vibe is probably a jury show - same performance as a semi-final, but cheaper, and also you can catch the actual semi on tv, where you'll actually be able to see and hear
09/01/2023, 16:03 - +44 7752 359588: I think the final will be expensive hell
09/01/2023, 16:03 - +44 7752 359588: But even if we can't get tickets, it could be fun to make it out to Liverpool to check out the village at some point!
09/01/2023, 16:03 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm pro this but Ella is arguing for the final as it's potentially a once in a lifetime type thing
09/01/2023, 16:05 - +44 7752 359588: I do take this point, but I guess I also figure when you're in the stadium you probably don't see or hear as much?
09/01/2023, 16:05 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah for me a jury show is the way to go as it's "extra" Eurovision
09/01/2023, 16:06 - Aaron Ayling: And a bit chiller I'd guess
09/01/2023, 16:06 - +44 7752 359588: Happy to see what others feel. Could also wait to see what ticket prices are, not sure if that'll be released before the actual Tix are out
09/01/2023, 16:07 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
09/01/2023, 16:10 - +44 7752 359588: That was what I was thinking, though could try for a final jury show too?
09/01/2023, 16:10 - +44 7752 359588: I reckon tickets might be hard to get across the board
09/01/2023, 16:12 - Reuben Yarwood: My preference would be final jury, but if we think they'll sell out too quickly I'm flexible!
09/01/2023, 16:13 - +44 7752 359588: I have no idea how the whole ticket thing works tbh, just that members of certain fan groups get first access
09/01/2023, 16:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Surely you are a member of these groups?
09/01/2023, 16:14 - +44 7752 359588: Ahaha I am not
09/01/2023, 16:14 - +44 7752 359588: If anything, I'm a casual fan
09/01/2023, 16:24 - Reuben Yarwood: We actually have tickets to see the Wagatha Christie play on 10th May
09/01/2023, 16:25 - Reuben Yarwood: Which I wouldn't mind cancelling but would prefer grand final jury show
09/01/2023, 17:09 - James Kemp: I think I‚Äôd wanna see price difference before I can offer an opinion on final or not
09/01/2023, 17:09 - James Kemp: Do we know how much each costs??
09/01/2023, 17:09 - James Kemp: (Sorry just seen you said we don‚Äôt‚Ä¶)
09/01/2023, 17:11 - James Kemp: I‚Äôm down with the crowd‚Äôs vibe - my first thoughts are final just because that‚Äôs the main show, but happy to be outvoted, and happy to cede if it‚Äôs a big price difference!!
09/01/2023, 17:12 - James Kemp: I want the win/lose drama of final stakes
09/01/2023, 17:22 - Reuben Yarwood: Apparently this was last year...

09/01/2023, 17:23 - Aaron Ayling: I'd assume it'd be worse in the UK
09/01/2023, 17:23 - James Kemp: Happy, in that case, to go with crowd vibe - won‚Äôt push final if it‚Äôs a similar price difference

09/01/2023, 19:42 - +44 7752 359588: Yep! Just out the door
09/01/2023, 19:46 - Aaron Ayling: I do love that skyline
09/01/2023, 19:53 - James Kemp: Oooh GURL
09/01/2023, 19:53 - James Kemp: Drop me here and let me float she‚Äôs stunning!! üòç
09/01/2023, 19:53 - James Kemp: Any colleagues starting to emerge as potential gooduns yet??
09/01/2023, 20:21 - +44 7752 359588: Sadly they mostly seem to be younger than me by a chunk or a bit standoffish
09/01/2023, 20:21 - +44 7752 359588: IT guy was nice
09/01/2023, 20:21 - +44 7752 359588: But also I haven't met the vast majority yet - office has been dead so far
09/01/2023, 20:25 - +44 7752 359588: I think Dani is gonna cream over the lake, I hope it's still warm in September!
09/01/2023, 20:44 - James Kemp: That‚Äôs rude
09/01/2023, 20:44 - James Kemp: I hate all my colleagues
09/01/2023, 20:44 - James Kemp: But am also never in the fucking office
09/01/2023, 21:07 - +44 7752 359588: Today was a waste of commute tbh, but also it's still novel to just be out of the damn house
09/01/2023, 21:07 - +44 7752 359588: (sorry @447912940213)
09/01/2023, 21:07 - +44 7752 359588: Left to languish with my parents
09/01/2023, 21:08 - +61 474 759 280: Can you take PT?
09/01/2023, 21:08 - +61 474 759 280: Or is that a silly question in America
09/01/2023, 21:14 - +44 7752 359588: What do you mean by PT?
09/01/2023, 21:25 - +61 474 759 280: Public transport
09/01/2023, 21:25 - +44 7752 359588: Oooh
09/01/2023, 21:25 - +44 7752 359588: I do take the train in, but I have to drive to the train
09/01/2023, 21:25 - +44 7752 359588: Once we move I'll be spoiled for choice!
09/01/2023, 21:26 - James Kemp: I am booting this acronym
09/01/2023, 21:26 - James Kemp: üåöüëÑ
09/01/2023, 21:26 - James Kemp: Is it an Aus thing?!
09/01/2023, 21:26 - +61 474 759 280: Yeah very common
09/01/2023, 21:27 - +61 474 759 280: No one would bat an eye at PT here
09/01/2023, 21:27 - James Kemp: I‚Äôd expect a bus to be a wheelo or something
09/01/2023, 21:27 - James Kemp: Surprisingly vanilla for Oz??!
09/01/2023, 21:29 - Reuben Yarwood: How long's your commute
09/01/2023, 21:30 - Reuben Yarwood: Publo transpo
09/01/2023, 21:30 - James Kemp: The new ‚Äúit‚Äôs getting dark outside‚Äù
09/01/2023, 21:30 - James Kemp: Man I am shady today
09/01/2023, 21:30 - James Kemp: Sorry guys ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã
09/01/2023, 21:31 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah I thought PT was part time or physical therapy
09/01/2023, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: Takes about an hour and fifteen mins
09/01/2023, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: I can drive in, which takes maybe 45-50 mins
09/01/2023, 21:32 - +44 7752 359588: But obviously a bit more expensive to park
09/01/2023, 21:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Not too bad, and you can wfh right?
09/01/2023, 21:43 - +44 7752 359588: Yep, three days a week!
09/01/2023, 21:43 - Reuben Yarwood: That'll do nicely!
09/01/2023, 21:44 - +61 474 759 280: The wheels totally fell off trying to enforce the split here, people just do whatever they want
09/01/2023, 21:46 - +44 7752 359588: They seem pretty strict, but also technically because I work for a special project the rules don't apply to me
09/01/2023, 21:46 - +44 7752 359588: So in theory could totally fuck right off
09/01/2023, 21:47 - +44 7752 359588: But in practice I'm supposed to be bridging the project team and the office team
10/01/2023, 01:12 - Aaron Ayling: https://tuble.co.uk/
11/01/2023, 01:51 - Aaron Ayling: Heya! So I would say semi final better than jury as theres the results and feels a bit more live but really either is great. Final tickets will be like trying to go to glastonbury, absolute gold dust. Also absolutely yes worth visiting the village if you don't get tickets. Obviously each one is unique and they do their own thing but they're bound to show it on big screens and it's a really nice atmosphere with everyone watching and unless they decide to change it this year, it's free. So you could try for final and semi final then see the other semi final in the village. Depending how long you're in Liverpool for you could also buy tickets for the Euro Club - where past entrants are performing on different nights https://euroclub.tv/liverpool 
I'd by a ticket to that sooner rather than later.
11/01/2023, 01:52 - Aaron Ayling: ^the Eurovision advice from Laura Cress who's done it a few times
11/01/2023, 02:16 - +44 7752 359588: Just to say euro club sounds like a dream
11/01/2023, 02:16 - +44 7752 359588: So maybe we aim for a semi eh?
11/01/2023, 02:17 - +44 7752 359588: And also we'll need to consider transport/where we're staying etc
11/01/2023, 06:40 - James Kemp: Happy with a semi
11/01/2023, 06:40 - James Kemp: Eyyyy
11/01/2023, 06:40 - James Kemp: When do we need to mobilize for the purchase??
11/01/2023, 08:54 - Sam Lea: TV semi feels like a good option instead of the final, you get the thrill of acts being booted / going through with less expense / stress
11/01/2023, 09:02 - Reuben Yarwood: Cool so we're talking around ¬£80-¬£250. I'm guessing we would rather do the second Semi on Thursday 11th, and stay in Liverpool for the final? Failing that I'm sure we could pile back to mine for the weekend.
11/01/2023, 09:02 - +44 7462 872590: Sounds like a plan üëç
11/01/2023, 09:04 - Reuben Yarwood: These Eurofans club parties go from 8pm - 6am
11/01/2023, 09:04 - Reuben Yarwood: Eurofans go hard!
11/01/2023, 09:09 - Reuben Yarwood: We could do PETITVISION which is the Friday Eurofans party. Then watch the final at an Airbnb or at mine on Saturday
11/01/2023, 09:11 - Reuben Yarwood: <Media omitted>
11/01/2023, 09:21 - Reuben Yarwood: I'm looking at AirBnBs and we're talking 400 quid each for Thu-Sunday.

11/01/2023, 13:03 - +44 7752 359588: Honestly this isn't even as bad as I would have expected
11/01/2023, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: I need to fully confirm I can get the week off before putting some dosh down, so I might need a couple days
11/01/2023, 13:04 - +44 7752 359588: But I like the sound of this plan
11/01/2023, 13:05 - +44 7752 359588: And my body is ready for the euro club, I have dreams of getting to party with serhat
11/01/2023, 13:06 - +44 7752 359588: Worse comes to worse and we don't get any tickets I'm still VERY down to catch the vibessss and do the euro village
11/01/2023, 13:07 - +44 7752 359588: This looks lush!! What are the plans? Also love how over it Dani is
11/01/2023, 13:11 - James Kemp: I am praying for this for you üôèüèª
11/01/2023, 13:12 - James Kemp: We would absolutely have to show him our group icon

11/01/2023, 13:12 - James Kemp: EXACTLY

23/01/2023, 16:48 - James Kemp: I let her off lightly as I figured she must be mortified!

06/02/2023, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: I mean fair on her cats
06/02/2023, 14:46 - +44 7752 359588: Those dogs are usually pretty expensive, so if she's giving it away for free, someone is getting a great deal
06/02/2023, 14:47 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah true!
06/02/2023, 14:48 - Reuben Yarwood: Imagine she tries to charge for it. "Give me a payrise and I might be able to afford it"
06/02/2023, 14:49 - +44 7752 359588: That would be ballsy
06/02/2023, 14:49 - Aaron Ayling: How long has she had the dog?
06/02/2023, 14:51 - Reuben Yarwood: No info but I assume not that long
06/02/2023, 14:51 - Reuben Yarwood: To be fair she emailed back 20 minutes later to see they'd found a home
06/02/2023, 14:52 - Reuben Yarwood: So I guess spamming the entire company works
06/02/2023, 14:56 - +44 7752 359588: Imagine agreeing to take the CEOs dog tho

07/02/2023, 17:47 - +44 7752 359588: I think the takeaway is that we're not getting anywhere with a decent lounge/shared space, but I imagine that doesn't matter too much
07/02/2023, 17:48 - +44 7752 359588: We could consider going for two places, 4 in each place, which on a quick glance doesn't seem like it'd be cheaper, but would probably result in nicer places to stay
07/02/2023, 17:49 - +44 7752 359588: My vote is probably for the third one in, for location and bathrooms

07/02/2023, 17:52 - James Kemp: Omg thank you for researching so much, Lizzard
07/02/2023, 17:52 - James Kemp: One other option to chuck into the mix at this stage: @447725504296 had mentioned staying at his and minivanning in??
07/02/2023, 17:53 - James Kemp: BRB yoga
07/02/2023, 17:53 - +44 7752 359588: Obviously there's not a massive selection of affordable stuff! We could consider fucking around with somewhere on a trainline outside of Liverpool, but I don't know how terrible public transport might be in this scenario!
07/02/2023, 17:54 - +44 7752 359588: Could we cram everyone into one minivan? I'd definitely be down for this, but also want to be respectful of the driving vibes, as sober eurovision might not be as fun!
07/02/2023, 18:02 - Reuben Yarwood: I was thinking as a backup we could hire one with a driver to take us back to Macc and stay at mine.
07/02/2023, 18:02 - +44 7752 359588: Ooooh
07/02/2023, 18:02 - +44 7752 359588: Private driver, swish
07/02/2023, 18:03 - Reuben Yarwood: It's about an hour and ten minute's drive which I'm sure I've done accross London before
07/02/2023, 18:05 - +44 7752 359588: I guess it's just a matter of finding someone who's also available for later night things!
07/02/2023, 18:06 - +44 7752 359588: Apparently one can also get a direct train from Stockport to Liverpool Lime street
07/02/2023, 18:07 - +44 7752 359588: I don't know how far you are from Stockport
07/02/2023, 18:08 - Reuben Yarwood: 20 mins
07/02/2023, 18:13 - +44 7752 359588: So that could also be a goer, depending on how late we think we'd be out, or for just one leg of the journey
07/02/2023, 18:38 - Aaron Ayling: Not averse to the minivan, but think I'd rather have a closer place to crash.

I'm more amenable to the minivan if someone else is sorting it all though!
07/02/2023, 19:28 - James Kemp: I have a light work day tomorrow so will have a look at researched options and input then!!
07/02/2023, 19:28 - James Kemp: This was literally what Dany and I took to get home on Saturday night üôà
07/02/2023, 19:29 - James Kemp: But yea - if you can bear with me a day, will have a look and contribute my own research tomorrow!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
07/02/2023, 19:40 - +44 7752 359588: Thanks!
07/02/2023, 19:42 - +44 7752 359588: I imagine it would really need to be a pre-booked taxi for that kind of distance and maybe preferably someone with some flexibility if we wanted to do one of the euro club nights
07/02/2023, 19:42 - James Kemp: Oh absolutely
07/02/2023, 19:42 - James Kemp: The idea of we did it would be prebook van with driver
07/02/2023, 19:42 - James Kemp: *if
07/02/2023, 19:42 - +44 7752 359588: (also I am calling shotgun now for the sake of my woogly, sometimes carsick stomach)
07/02/2023, 19:43 - James Kemp: I‚Äôll look at cost options to see if it‚Äôs even worse considering then we can weigh up that alongside all other pros/cons
07/02/2023, 19:43 - +44 7752 359588: Can we request that they play only the most top tier Eurovision bangers?
07/02/2023, 19:43 - James Kemp: Do we know when tickets go on sale??
07/02/2023, 19:43 - +44 7752 359588: They say end of Feb
07/02/2023, 19:43 - James Kemp: 70 minutes of Serhat
07/02/2023, 19:44 - +44 7752 359588: Just NaNaNa 20 times in a row
07/02/2023, 19:44 - James Kemp: How many times can we say nanana before we arrive
07/02/2023, 19:49 - +44 7752 359588: In other, better, music news, apparently Thursday is going to be a Kate bush day on 6music, celebrating the anniversary of her first album
07/02/2023, 23:55 - +44 7752 359588: In further music news, KIM PETRAS IS A GRAMMY WINNER LOLOLOL

08/02/2023, 15:13 - +44 7752 359588: Ugh this looks so lush
08/02/2023, 15:13 - +44 7752 359588: I miss outside
08/02/2023, 15:20 - James Kemp: I agree with this!!
08/02/2023, 15:21 - James Kemp: I am definitely not enough of a human to walk an hour
08/02/2023, 15:21 - James Kemp: Also dgaf about a lounge
08/02/2023, 15:22 - James Kemp: So it‚Äôs like ¬£300 pp, basically
08/02/2023, 15:22 - +44 7752 359588: They all have bus public transport too, I just didn't include times because I was looking so late at night in the UK that the timings were off
08/02/2023, 15:22 - +44 7752 359588: But they should all be 45 minutes or less on the bus
08/02/2023, 15:22 - James Kemp: I feel like a Liverpudlian bus is a vibe I don‚Äôt care to fuck with
08/02/2023, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: I mean I never fuck with a bus lol
08/02/2023, 15:23 - James Kemp: Putting it plainly
08/02/2023, 15:23 - +44 7752 359588: Obviously cabs are also an option for those too, I think most are like a 10-15 minute drive
08/02/2023, 15:23 - James Kemp: I just like not having to rely on public transport?
08/02/2023, 15:24 - James Kemp: And if we can get that, I say why wouldn‚Äôt we get that??
08/02/2023, 15:24 - James Kemp: Price isn‚Äôt any cheaper further out also??
08/02/2023, 15:24 - +44 7752 359588: I agree with all points there
08/02/2023, 15:25 - +44 7752 359588: I should note this is also for wed-sat, so three nights, which I think is what we agreed
08/02/2023, 15:25 - James Kemp: @447725504296 what‚Äôs your address?
08/02/2023, 15:25 - +44 7752 359588: But could easily cut a night too, and I think most of these bookings would let us
08/02/2023, 15:25 - James Kemp: We can weigh up against minivan
08/02/2023, 15:26 - James Kemp: Also nobody‚Äôs replying so if we don‚Äôt actually get 8, can go smaller which miiiiiight be cheaper idk?
08/02/2023, 15:28 - James Kemp: Because I will cut an unresponsive bitch if it means I can save some ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£
08/02/2023, 15:28 - James Kemp: üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
08/02/2023, 15:28 - +44 7752 359588: I think it gives more options - I had a quick look at some of the smaller ones to see if two separate bookings made more sense and there didn't seem to be a massive price difference, but also I only spent about 5 minutes skimming, so something might exist!

09/02/2023, 20:26 - +44 7752 359588: Sadly, my new job doesn't quite give me the same level of ridiculous application personal statements, but I did enjoy this from a letter of recommendation: "Life has not unfolded in a way to make us 
personal friends. (I do not say this to imply that we are social nemeses, but rather to indicate that our interactions have not included the kinds of beyond-work interactions that would characterize a friendship.)"
09/02/2023, 20:26 - +44 7752 359588: Like ALRIGHT

09/02/2023, 20:35 - +44 7752 359588: He spent a chunk of the letter talking about how he didn't really know the guy, so he isn't biased. But also... Are you qualified to comment???
09/02/2023, 22:28 - James Kemp: Oh man
09/02/2023, 22:38 - Reuben Yarwood: Wow, if that is the best thing you can get anyone to say about you...
09/02/2023, 22:38 - Reuben Yarwood: "well, we're not NEMESES"
09/02/2023, 22:59 - +44 7752 359588: Please say this at my funeral
09/02/2023, 22:59 - Reuben Yarwood: I can confirm that I was acquainted with Elizabeth Mucha

10/02/2023, 07:25 - +61 474 759 280: It‚Äôs less cumbersome than a tent usually, more streamlined set up
10/02/2023, 07:26 - +61 474 759 280: They‚Äôre usually the size of a body bag but I couldn‚Äôt resist going large

12/02/2023, 21:18 - +44 7752 359588: Alright, re Eurovision - Aaron and I have had a chat and I just don't think we'll have an hour commute each way in us. Between jetlag, me being a carsick bitch, and potential back issues for aaron, we'd rather just be in the city i think
12/02/2023, 21:18 - +44 7752 359588: Respect if you still want to come in from Macc - we're happy to just meet up!
12/02/2023, 21:19 - +44 7752 359588: But would like to know ASAP because places are going like hotcakes
12/02/2023, 21:20 - James Kemp: Dany & I in for booking a place with yous in Liverpool!
12/02/2023, 21:20 - James Kemp: Also happy to forego the hour‚Äôs drive tbQh

12/02/2023, 21:54 - Sam Lea: I think it's probs the more ideal scenario, isn't it. Means we can have a good time and not have to overlying constrain ourselves / concern ourselves with timings and whatever.
12/02/2023, 21:55 - Sam Lea: That said, just how much extra are we talking, accomopricewise?
13/02/2023, 07:33 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah I hear yas, happy to book something nearer Liverpool.
13/02/2023, 07:45 - Reuben Yarwood: Ella has family in Liverpool so she doesn't want to splash out on and Airbnb. But that means we could find somewhere smaller perhaps. I don't mind a sofa if it's just me.
13/02/2023, 07:47 - Reuben Yarwood: The four bed one Liz found was 300 each (for 8 of us?)
13/02/2023, 07:49 - Reuben Yarwood: She's basically living off her savings this year while she writes the book
13/02/2023, 13:53 - +44 7752 359588: That's very fair!
13/02/2023, 13:55 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think anyone actually priced out the driver, so not sure, but yes this one is coming out to about ¬£300 a person for 8, or ¬£333/pp for 7.
13/02/2023, 13:56 - +44 7752 359588: I don't think you're going to find anything cheaper for 3 bedrooms tbh - I did have a look at some, and most things closer to the city centre are gone. But very happy for someone else to have a search!
13/02/2023, 13:58 - +44 7752 359588: I've actually gone ahead and booked this place because it's a full refund if you cancel before may 5 and I'm nervous about things getting booked üòÖ, but obviously if others are opting to be elsewhere, would like to know ASAP, because smaller places are also going fast!
13/02/2023, 13:59 - Reuben Yarwood: Thank you Liz!
13/02/2023, 14:04 - +44 7752 359588: We may weirdly see some places released after tickets go on sale, as I imagine some people who don't get tickets will cancel
13/02/2023, 14:04 - +44 7752 359588: But I just don't want to count on it
13/02/2023, 14:05 - +44 7752 359588: Speaking of, would suggest booking a club night or two, as according to Laura those do sell out!
13/02/2023, 14:09 - Reuben Yarwood: So current plan is this AirBnB from Thursday to Sunday (3 nights)

13/02/2023, 14:13 - +44 7752 359588: Ooh I thought we said Wednesday through Saturday, so leaving day of the final to watch in elsewhere
13/02/2023, 14:13 - Reuben Yarwood: Euroclub night on Friday 12th May. ¬£18
https://euroclub.tv/liverpool
13/02/2023, 14:14 - Reuben Yarwood: Oh gotcha. I don't think we ever settled on the deets. But it would be fun to watch the final @chez Yarwood on Saturday
13/02/2023, 14:15 - +44 7752 359588: I think we'd be well down for that
13/02/2023, 14:16 - Reuben Yarwood: Especially if the flat doesn't have a living room
13/02/2023, 14:17 - +44 7752 359588: Or the Wednesday! I feel the call of both!
13/02/2023, 14:17 - +44 7752 359588: Altho petit vision is my greatest opportunity to see serhat I think
13/02/2023, 14:17 - +44 7752 359588: Yeah it has one, it just looks very very teensy given the number of people this flat can accommodate
13/02/2023, 14:19 - Aaron Ayling: Yeah would be well down for this!
13/02/2023, 14:23 - +44 7752 359588: Another thing to consider: if we don't get semi tickets, these dates would allow us to try for the jury semi show Wednesday, the family show Thursday afternoon, and the jury final show Friday
13/02/2023, 14:23 - +44 7752 359588: It might not be a bad idea to have an order of preference for when tickets go on sale
13/02/2023, 14:35 - Reuben Yarwood: Yeah great shout
13/02/2023, 17:41 - +44 7462 872590: Thanks Liz, I can jump in on this
13/02/2023, 21:56 - James Kemp: I will blindly follow
13/02/2023, 21:57 - James Kemp: Liz I trust your Eurovision expertise just tell me which buttons to push ‚ù§Ô∏è
13/02/2023, 21:57 - James Kemp: Do you have any fave entries yet?? Or are we still too early?
13/02/2023, 22:03 - +44 7752 359588: I'm just starting to catch up!!! Watched a few of the ones that are out - no stand outs for me, but a bunch just got released in the last week and a half (including some of the usually strong contenders) so need to get on those!

15/02/2023, 19:50 - +44 7752 359588: This is also absolutely the start of the Johnny Stowellman noir detective series, in which you solve a decade old cold case going off these files
15/02/2023, 19:51 - +44 7752 359588: Maybe a 2 decades old case, given that that's a VHS
15/02/2023, 21:54 - +61 474 759 280: Ten years ago I‚Äôd have dropped everything in my day to find a VHS player
15/02/2023, 22:30 - +44 7752 359588: Did you take the stuff or leave it?
15/02/2023, 22:31 - +44 7752 359588: It feels like taking it is also how you end up mixed up in some criminal conspiracy
15/02/2023, 22:31 - +44 7752 359588: Also our library let's you digitize VHS's and I love the idea of just bringing a crime tape in to do that
16/02/2023, 22:01 - +44 7752 359588: Very amped to be coming back to the UK to see y'all, but fml I did not realize we are literally flying in on the day of the coronation
